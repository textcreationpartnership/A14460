            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A PREFACE, DE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CLARING ALL SVCH MATTERS AS ARE TO BE <hi>handled and treated of, within this preſent hooke.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>ITH we are now growne to an end of that Cronicle which wee were determined to make, concerning the Actes and deeds of Popes, whereby their holineſſe, &amp; the reſt of their ordinances, may the better be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned and iudged: I haue not thought it amiſſe to make ſome diſcourſe of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons and decrees made and eſtabliſhed in the Councelles which haue bene ſolemnelie helde from the Apoſtles time, euen vnto this preſent. I meane of the Canons &amp; decrees, which touch thoſe matters that we nowe intend to treat of. Howbeit there are manie cauſes which giue me occaſion, at this time not to deal with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The firſt is, for that I fear the book will grow to be ouer great, as I ſee it fal out by another booke of mine, which I tooke in hand intituled, <hi>Of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and conference of the Supper of the Lorde, and the Maſſe:</hi> Albeit I did at that time cut of manie thinges, which might verie well haue bene ſet foorth. The other is, That a great part of the Decrees and Canons of the Councelles appar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to that matter which we preſentlie are to treate of, are attributed to the Romiſh Biſhops, &amp; eſpeciallie to thoſe who at that time enioyed that ſea, wherein, thoſe Councels were ſolemnized. And therefore the greater part of them hath alreadie bene publiſhed and ſet abrode. Moreouer I do alſo conſider, that theſe Canons and decrees which are aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned vnto the ancient Councelles, are often alotted vnto them vnder a falſe title, as manie other ordinances alſo are attributed to manie auncient Romiſh Biſhops, who neuer
<pb facs="tcp:19770:4"/>once thought of them: and were falſlie collected euen by the very ſelfe ſame men which vpheld the Popiſh ſea, &amp; all the abuſes and ſuperſtitions that euer were brought into Chriſtendome. Wherefore, it is moſt neceſſarie, that when anie Councelles are ſpoken of, that they which reade the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> call to mind that, which we haue ſpoken of, in our other booke, concerning the witneſſes by vs produced, for the ſetting downe of thoſe ordinances attributed to Popes, of whom we haue made mention. For therein is likewiſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted great leaſings, by the reaſon of the knowledge and practiſe of a great number of falſe witneſſes by whom Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt hath ſerued his owne turne, that by them he might obtaine a glorious glittering ſhewe vnto his falſe religion &amp; tyrannie, and chieflie vnder the title of antiquitie and aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Councelles: vnder which colour, the Suppoſtes of the Romiſh Church labour with tooth and naile, to quench the truth and word of the Lord. And therefore it is verie requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite that the matter be well looked vnto. For, as wee muſt not lightly contemne the authoritie of the lawfull &amp; Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Councelles: euen ſo likewiſe we muſt be well aduiſed how we allow vnlawfull Councelles, for lawfull, and that er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, ſuperſtitions, and hereſies, be not allowed &amp; receaued vnder the colour of Chriſtian Councelles. And beſides, we muſt alſo vnderſtand thus much, That there was neuer any Councell ſo pure &amp; Chriſtian like ſithens the Apoſtles time wherein ſom chaffe hath not bene mixed with the Corne, yea, &amp; ſome notable beginning of ſuperſtition alſo: by which meane Antichriſt ſoone after, hath not gotten ſome mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to build an houſe for his raigne, and to work his ſecrete iniquitie withall. Wherefore, we are with very ſound iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to reade, whatſoeuer is ſet downe vnto vs vnder the name of Councelles and auncient Fathers, and not lightlie approue any thing, vntill ſuch time as we haue thoroughly examined the cauſe by the preſcript rule of Gods word. For which cauſes I haue purpoſlie ſet downe this aduertiſement, as well by reaſon of the Cannons and decrees which haue hertofore ſometimes bene alleaged, vnder the name of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Councelles, as alſo (if neede were) for thoſe, which hereafter might be alleaged for the declaration, and anno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
<pb facs="tcp:19770:4"/>which we haue yet to make, as well vpon the Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telles or inſtructions, as vpon the forme and manner of the Maſſe, which we are now in hand to go on withall. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we wold be glad to obſerue the beſt order that might be, we will beginne at the Inſtruction which the Prieſtes in their Maſſe bookes call, <hi>The Cautelles of the Maſſe:</hi> Becauſe they are taught by them, thoſe things which he is to obſerue that meaneth to ſay Maſſe, and of the dangers which therin might fall out: as may very well be diſcerned by the reading of them. And therefore by a barbarous word they call them <hi>Cautelles,</hi> chieſlie by reaſon of the ſenſe, which they meane to take at it, ſignifying thereby, that euerie Prieſt muſt take good heede vnto that which is ſet downe in them: although in verie deede this word <hi>Cautell,</hi> properly ſignifieth nothing elſe, but falſhood and deceipt. Wherefore, they them ſelues ſpeake more likely and truly in this behalfe then they think: conſidering, that whatſoeuer is in their Maſſe, is nothing elſe but mere trumperie and deceipt, and a common ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of all Chriſtian people. And in verie deede, I haue ſet them foorth after the ſelfe ſame maner and forme, as they are ſet downe in their Popiſh Maſſe booke, which title is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie in the beginning of this booke propoſed and faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie tranſlated: to the end that euery man might the better vnderſtand, the notable follies and horrible abhominations which are in the Maſſe, and in all thoſe which celebrate the ſame, and are at it. And for the better helping of the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the Readers, I haue added thereto certaine ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions &amp; annotations, to make the matters more plaine. Howbeit, I am to beſeech the Readers, not to be lightly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended at them, although they ſeeme very groſſe &amp; ſtrange Becauſe I am to make them agree with the text, which is to be declared: and is in verie trueth worthy the gloſe which ſhall be giuen thereto: which ſhal not be a gloſe of Orlea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, contrarie to the text, but neat and pure, and of it ſelfe. And to the end that euery iot therof might be the better vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, I haue deuided the matters into Chapters: &amp; beſides, haue ſet downe the annotations of euerie of them in order, one after another: and marked by the Alphabet and cifers
<pb facs="tcp:19770:5"/>euerie annotation, according as the letters are marked in the text, to the end it might be the better vnderſtood, vnto what place euerie of them is to be referred.</p>

                  <hi>c</hi> To gather him ſelfe vp roundly together, ought to be vnderſtood of the thoughtes of his mind, which he is to gather and bind vp together as it were in a fagot: to the end they might be faſt bound vp together: ſo that their mindes ſhould euer runne vpon their bellies and vpon the maids, vpon whom my Sir whips haue oftentimes more mind, then vpon their conſecration: which is a very dangerous matter, eſpecially in this place, by reaſon the people ſhould become flat idolaters in worſhipping the hoſt, if ſo be the Prieſt ſhould not rightly conſecrate: which he is neuer able to do if his mind be not fully and wholy thereon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>d</hi> He is to chaunge theſe wordes, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce wordes cleane contrary to the wordes of Ieſus Chriſt, to wit: Take not nor eate not any of you of this: ſeeing that none dare once take or eate any of this, ſaue the Prieſt alone.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>e</hi> This is meant if he be not broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> winded, or if ſo be he hath not bene ſo foundred, &amp; ſo ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken with the Pope, as that he is not able to take his breath.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>f</hi> In our language, this word My, is not the laſt word, but the Body is the laſt. For we do not
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:19770:11"/>ſay Body mine, but, my bodie: neither do we ſay, This is body mine. And therefore ſeing the whole vertue of the conſecration and tranſubſtantiatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hangeth vpon the laſt word, he muſt not ſay, For this is my body: But ought to ſay, ſhalbe. For o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe the bread ſhold be body, before it were, becauſe it is not vntill the laſt word. For, all the words cannot be ſpoken at one choppe. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides our venerable Maiſters ſhould be greatly troubled about the difficulties that are in this matter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>g</hi> They feared that the Prieſt ſhould eate him ſelfe and his owne body, as they ſay that Chriſt did eate him ſelfe and his owne body, fleſhe and bones, and that he dranke his owne natural blood in the Supper which he made vnto his Apoſtles. For, if theſe wordes be ſaid in the perſon of the Prieſt, then the bread ſhall be conuerted into the Prieſtes body, and not into Ieſus his body.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>h</hi> There is much to do in wordes, about the intent of the Prieſt, becauſe as they teach, all the power of conſecration &amp; tranſubſtantiation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth therein: ſo that neither the pronunciation of the words are auailable in this matter, neither yet the faith and intent of as many as are preſent at Maſſe, if the intent of the Prieſt be not before them all in it. And yet there is another point to be conſidered of, which is this: That if his minde ſhould be ſo troubled as that in conſecrating the one, he intended to conſecrate the other, and had any ſuch intent, then all his paine were loſt: to wit, if he meant to conſecrate the wine, when he
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:19770:11"/>was about the conſecrating of the bread, or pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to conſecrate the bread, when he was a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the ordinance of Ieſus Chriſt: But they will beſides alſo, becauſe they can abide no e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualitie, that the prieſt which ſhall adminiſter the ſupper publikly that day, ſhall haue his God by him ſelfe, and ſuch a one as ſhalbe both larger and honorablier then any other, and both eate him, &amp; drinke his wine all alone by him ſelfe long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any of the reſt: making firſt of all, euery man, moſt ſolemnely and magnifically worſhip his God, which ſoone after he eateth. And therefore it is here ſaid, that he is to haue a farre greater co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration and minde vpon him, then vpon any of the other, which lie there diſhonorably, and do not ſo much as once pitch or turne as the other doth, who danſeth alone with his venerable Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter whip. And therefore he playeth with theſe poore Gods, as the poore yong ſluttes which go to the danſing games are dealt withall, whom none take into the danſe, making no reckning of them, but ſtand by, gaſing vpon the faire virgines which do danſe. For, euery man knoweth how whipped Sir Hugh ſporteth with his God, and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:19770:12"/>how many friskes, gamboldes, and capriaes, and what reuerences, reprinſes, and braules, he vſeth: and how he lifteth, &amp; toſſeth him aboue his head, &amp; ſome time on this ſide and on that, &amp; vnder his armes. To be ſhort, I can not be able to vtter vnto you the nombers of ſleightes of legier demaine, which he ſo gallantly maketh him play.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>b</hi> Now Sir, when he maketh ſo many Gods at once, he hath no reaſon, properly to ſay, This is my body: but ſhould rather ſay, Theſe are my bodyes. But he may very well ſay it by the blood, bycauſe that in his conſecration, he turneth none of the wine into blood, ſaue onely that which is in his chalice which he iuggleth into it: which blood he maketh onely for the body of his owne God, and for none of the reſt. And therefore it muſt nedes be, that either the reſt haue no blood, or els that he maketh their blood all at once with the bodies: As in very deede it ought to be, if this bread were turned, and as they ſay, really, eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially, ſubſtantially, ſenſibly, and corporally tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiated into the naturall body of Ieſus Chriſt: or elſe it cannot be choſen but that the reſt of the bodyes which are made for the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> people, haue no blood at all in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And although the prieſtes God, hath blood, yet bycauſe it is ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from the body, therefore it cannot be but a dead body, becauſe a liuing body is not without blood. Wherefore the body of the God which they eate is a dead body.

                  <hi>b</hi> Nowe becauſe there muſt be alwayes gods
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:19770:13"/>in the pixe, ready to carie to thoſe that are ſicke, when neede ſhall be, and alſo to honour &amp; keepe the Church, therefore they muſt often times be renued, and newe put in, in their ſteade, for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe they would be mouldy and filthy. And ſo by that meane they ſhould not remaine white gods, but mouldye and greene gods: as manie times it commeth to paſſe through the neglige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, ſecureneſſe, and default of their Gard, as hereafter ſhall be ſhewed. Nowe, when theſe gods are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, the Prieſt which renueth them, muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie eate the old ones, and put in for them ſpan newe ones. But whenſoeuer there is a generall receauing of their maker (as they ſay) if it ſo fall out, as that there be not as many receauers to eate as there are Gods to be eaten, either the Prieſt muſt eate all that are left, or elſe he muſt giue to eche man, more then one peece, either elſe put them into the pixe to be afterward diſtributed, as we haue before ſaid. And for the greater ſolemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing of the banquet, when as Maſt Perſon is to gobble them vp, it muſt commonly be done when he is at Maſſe. But becauſe the ſame hoſt which the Prieſt hath renued, is the more honorable and ſurer, he for his honours ſake goeth foremoſt, and is firſt ſwallowed vp. For M. Iohn Shorne is not ſo certaine of the other olde Gods, as he is of his owne newe one: as well by reaſon that ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther blacke-Smithes might haue made them, as alſo, for that it is poſſible, they might haue beene changed: And therefore it is here ſaid, that he is ſure of his owne: that is to ſay, that he hath brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:19770:14"/>vpon it, with a good intent, to make a ioly, braue, round and white God of it, like to a iolie large ſliſe of a Turnipe: But he is not ſo certaine of any of the reſt, nor yet of the intent of my mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters the black-Smithes that forged them. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is ſaid, That he beleeueth all that the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther holy Church of Rome vſeth, but he is not aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured of it. And therefore he walketh in the faith of Prieſthood, which is well to be conſidered of. For, either faith is ioyned with knowledge or without knowledge. And if knowledge be ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with faith, what maner of faith can that be, which knoweth not that, that it beleeueth? But if it be faith without knowledge, then is not the other faith, which is ioyned with knowledge. And ſo both on the one ſide &amp; on the other, there is faith, without faith. I doubt not but that our maiſters could diſtinguiſh here very well: But let them make what diſtinction they luſt, they know neither Chriſtian faith, nor yet Chriſtian know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. For, they haue no foundation from the word of the Lord of all that they here bring in.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>c</hi> I vnderſtand by the waſhings that are here ſpoken of, of the laſt finger licking which the Prieſt maketh, after he hath eaten his God, &amp; his fleſh, &amp; dro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>k his blood, the laſt time that he pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in wine into his chalice, as well for the waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and rinſing of his teeth as of his fingers &amp; cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice: to the ende there ſhould neither fleſhe, or blood, remaine either in his throte, handes, nor Chalice. And becauſe this laſt wine that is pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in, is not blood, as is the firſt, it behoueth him
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:19770:14"/>to eate all the Gods that are to be eaten, before ſuch time as he powreth in this laſt wine for the rinſing of his teeth and fingers, for otherwiſe they ſhould not be eaten to breake-faſt: which were a moſt grieuous &amp; deadly ſinne. But when it is blood, then it is another matter. And the Prieſt hath neuer broken his faſt, no though he eate ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo many of his round ſinging cakes which are turned into Gods, vntill he be ready to burſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all: and drinke as much wine turned into blood, as that he be as dronke as a piſſe-pot, and ſo, be ready to burſt and kill him ſelfe withall.</p>

And therefore, were all theſe goodly inſtructions and cautelles heretofore ſet downe concerning this matter, which might like wiſe aſ well ſerue for the worke of miracles, as the hoſtes many times ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, by turning of water into wine. For, they were not to powre in ſo much water, as that it might eaſely be diſcerned to be ſo. Howbeit, to returne to the tranſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the water, it is to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that that is two wayes to be conſidered of: for, it muſt firſt, be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerted into wine, and after that, from wine, into blood: for elſe, it is impoſſible to be ſaid, to be tranſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiated.

Some of them do it about the middeſt of the Maſſe, when as they come towardes the ſecrettes thereof: or, if they haue already done it, they conſider whether they haue committed any offence therein yea or no. Now, theſe daungers fall out the rather, when as
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:19770:22"/>theſe iolly Sir Shornes are troubled in minde, as hath many times hapned in this countrey, whenas at the beginning, the Goſpell began here to be firſt preached. For, ſo ſoone as any Miniſter or Preacher of the Goſpell, were once entred into any citie or towne, and that the Prieſtes vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood that he was come thether to Preach, they were oftentimes without either ſens or memory: which is a moſt neceſſarie thing to be had in ſuch a caſe.

And when any man that is with them at Maſſe perceaueth it, and telleth them of it, they make this aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, Theſe Deuilles ſo trouble vs, as that we know not where we are. But there are many who can eſpecially teſtifie, how often this hath bene ſpoken by that good and faithfull ſeruant of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt our good brother Farel, whoſe name onely hath more feared them, then euer the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils did, whome they coniured with their holy water, or yet with bell booke, and candle. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, God hath ſhewed his great power, condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning by the Iudge, theſe ſeducers as malefactours,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:19770:23"/>euen in their owne conſciences, and hath put them into the handes of the Lord chiefe Iuſtice both of heauen and earth. No doubt of it, out prieſtes had neuer more neede of theſe cautelles, then at this preſent they haue, conſidering how fearefull and amazed they are, being no whit at all perſecuted. Howbeit they haue good cauſe ſo to be. For, it geueth their kitchins a vile blow. And beſides, there enſueth a worſe matter here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on then ſo, becauſe they are not able as they would, make their kitchin fier burne ſo bright as mighr roſte thoſe which goe about to put it out, being next cooſin Germaine to the fier of Purgatorie, wherewith they ſeeth, roſte, and bake, all that they eate, at the coſte and charges of the poore ſoules which lye there to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted and fryed.</p>

                  <hi>f</hi> And if this ſhould be ſo, Then the prieſt ſhould eate in this Maſſe, two bodyes of God, the laſt of which, and not, the firſt, ſhould ſoone after, be well moiſted with his blood. And the firſt, ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten without blood.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>g</hi> This, is throughly to be conſidered of. For, if Chriſtians ſhould not ſee theſe ſeducers knaue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, they ſhould be in great hazard, and commit great offence againſt their kitchin.</p>

                  <hi>i</hi> Note, That here, the bread is ſtill called bread, both after the conſecration, and after the eating of it alſo: which is ſo great an hereſie, as who ſo euer holdeth it, is worthie to frie a fagot.

But here, although it be called bread, yet for all that, we muſt vnderſtand it to be fleſh. And therfore it behoueth maiſter Goblin to ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low downe the water to his breakefaſt, for feare that in caſting vp the water, he caſte vp withall ſome peece of fleſh that might ſticke in his teeth, or remaine in his mouth.</p>

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, and ſo riddeth them of the doubt which otherwiſe might torment them. It ſhould ſeeme that this cautell meaneth to ſhew this attritio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, by this deſier of the grace of contrition, whereof it maketh mention: whereas the other kind is called contuſion, which is taken from a word which ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth to brooſe and breake, as a man ſtampeth in a morter a thing that is very great into a nom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of great peeces, and not into powder.

And ſo might the like fall out with anie of the reſt, after they haue come from di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpling of their harlots. Wherefore, if they can not haue this contrition in them vpon the ſodeine or preſently, yet let them haue at the leaſt attrition or contuſion, and be ſory that they can not be ſo hartely ſory for their ſinnes as they woulde, or ought to be.

The tale is thus: There was in thoſe daies an old Fryer Iacobin, in the coue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the Iacobins of the ſame place, who was almoſt ſo throughlie rotten with the pockes, as that he was readie to fall in peeces. Howbeit I meane here to ſuppreſſe his name, although I right well knowe both his Chriſten and ſurname. This fatherly old Sir ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing forborn ſaying of Maſſe a long time, neither yet hauing either made or eaten any Gods a long ſpace by reaſon of his age and feebleneſſe, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to honor his ioly mealy God vpon his owne feſtiuall day, went to Maſſe. Howbeit his ſtomach was neither able to beare nor yet digeſt either the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:19770:34"/>body of his God which he had eaten, or yet the blood of him which he had dronke. Whereupon, as he thought to returne to his chamber, paſſing through the couent Cloiſter, it ſo fell out, as that he caſt his gorge, right before the Chapter dore. I will here leaue to your conſiderations, what drugges he voyded out of the ſhop of this miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble rotten pockie ſtomach, and howe this God which he had eaten was dreſt. Hereupon foorth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with aroſe a noiſe and great affray all the couent ouer. And becauſe the Prior was not there, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon he was gone to preach not farre of, all the reſt of the Friers were the more amazed and vnproui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of councell. Neuertheleſſe they were at the laſt aduiſed, after long co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſultatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to ſet ouer this holy body, that tabernacle, which they were wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to ſet ouer the ſepulchres, when they ſing for the dead, and this was done becauſe none ſhould beſtride this holy vomite, or, for that the dogges ſhould not licke it vp. For this was a meete diſhe of meate to banquet them withall. And to adde more honour to this holy vomite, there were four waxe tapres ſet at the foure corners of the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle. After this, the nouices were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded to ſing all the whole day, this verſicle of the Hymne of the ſaid Feaſt, which beginneth thus, <hi>Tantum ergo Sacramentum, veneremur cernui, &amp;c.</hi> That is to ſay: Let vs then, enclining and bowing our ſelues to the ground, honour this ſo great and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent a Sacrament: which was aſmuch to ſay at that time, as this vomit of this olde fatherly Iakrum: which no doubt, was a very noble and
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:19770:34"/>moſt famous ſacrament. They ſong alſo the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiphone of the ſame day, which beginneth thus, <hi>O Sacrum conuiuium,</hi> that is to ſay, O holy Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet. And in very deede they had great reaſon ſo to ſing. For they were worthie to haue it, that ſo honored it. Howbeit there was not one of them all, that would once taſte of it, as holy as it was: For, after they had thus honored it, they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to haue ſome prieſt or deacon amongeſt them, who ſhould ſlippe downe this holy ba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quet into his Gorge, as is their iolly maner &amp; cuſtome, and as the Cautelles, which we preſently haue handled, do teach. Howbeit, there was neuer a Iacke of them all that once durſt be ſo bolde and arrogant as to take it in hand, and thinke him ſelfe worthie thereof: in ſo much that they all, could neuer with a better heart haue ſaid, <hi>Domine, non ſum dignus vt intres ſub tectum meum,</hi> when as they meane to eate their God as at that time they ſaid: to wit, Lord, I am not worthy that thou ſhouldeſt come vnder my houſe rouſe: to wit, to be ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed downe and lodged in his ſtomach. Thus here we ſee,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 8. <hi>Luc.</hi> 5.6.</note> to what ſence theſe blaſphemers ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie theſe holy wordes of this good Centurion, who ſpake vnto Ieſus Chriſt. Wherefore ſeeing they all ſo vtterly refuſed it, it behoued them to take ſome other counſell: that is to ſay, that this holy vomit ſhould be reuerently ſhoueld toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and gathered vp, with the God in the pyxe, and that the ground whereon he laye, ſhould be carefully and ſpeedely pared, and ſo be carried to the church. When they had hereupon concluded,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:19770:35"/>The Suppriour (whoſe name I forbeare to tell, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit I right well know it) put on his holy veſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, and anon, al the Friers of the couent went to church in a ſolemne proceſſion and two No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices going before this holy Shrine with candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtickes and tapres. Which Nouices are preſently here with vs who can witneſſe the whole matter. And no maruel though they vtterly forſooke ſuch a kind of religion, &amp; ſuch doctrine, when as they had ſeene the ientle practize thereof. For who is he that can abide to heare and thinke of theſe thinges, without great horrour? Howbeit who can not but maruell, that all Chriſtendome, hath not bene plonged tenne millions of times more ouer hed and eares, amongeſt whome ſo horrible and great blaſphemies and abhominations, haue ſo long continued, yea euen amongeſt thoſe that were thought to be the very pillers of the church? For here we manifeſtly ſee by theſe Cauteles, that the practize hereof hath bene ſo common, as that it hath bene regiſtred in writing. Who would euer haue thought or beleued, that Chriſtian people could haue fallen, I will not ſaye into ſuch bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſhnes, but into ſuch rage and furie? For, what is furie and madneſſe, if theſe be not it? Had they not great reaſon to perſecute and burne all ſuch as would not giue credit to ſuch mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtrous abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, and worſhip the vomit of ſuch ſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king pocky Iackes? O the goodneſſe of God, how couldeſt thou be ſo patient, as once to abide ſuch horrible blaſphemies, againſt the holy maieſtie of thy ſonne Ieſus Chriſt? But ſith theſe abominable
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:19770:35"/>wretches are not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tented onely not to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge their faultes, but that which is worſe, that where as they them ſelues well deſerued to be fleane or roſted a liue, and yet perſecuted &amp; burnt ſuch as would not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to theſe greuous wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, are they not well worthie to be manifeſted to be ſuch as in very deede they are, euen by their owne bookes and deedes? Go to now then, you my maiſters the Iacobins, you I ſay my maiſters the Inquinatours, Inquiſitours I would haue ſaid, of the Faith, Go on I ſay and ſtay not to perſecute and burne ſuch as will not worſhippe the Gods, which you and ſuch as you your ſelues are, vomit vp, and honour them in proceſſion with you. But now to make an ende of this hiſtorie. After that my lord Suppriour, and all the whole couent were reueſted, and had ſet them ſelues in order to go on proceſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the ground with all ſpeed was pared, and the holy vomit gathered vp, with iolly holy and anointed fingers. Then began ſome of the Iacobins a freſh to howle vp their notes, &amp; other ſome of the moſt hypocriticall ſort of them, when they ſaw this ſo dolefull &amp; pityfull a ſpectacle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to mourne and wepe. For, this inconuenience greatly troubled their ſolemne feaſt. After that this holy vomit was brought to the church in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, they fell againe in counſell, to know what ſhould be done with it. Then, ſome of the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cienteſt doctours of the couent were of the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that it ſhould be burnt, and the aſhes of it be put vp and kept in a Shrine. For, they thought it better ſo to deale with it, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſuffer it any longer,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:19770:36"/>to rot and corrupt. Wherein they very well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued and put in practize that which is appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by this Cautelle. Now, by this hiſtorie, euery man may the better iudge of the reſt, and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with him ſelfe, whether there be any dirtie &amp; filthie dealing in this popiſh religion yea or no.</p>

You, euen you your ſelues at this very preſent, expound the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> your ſelues: for you manifeſtly declare that your meaning heretofore, was to ſignifie the ſame, by theſe wordes, Euchariſte, Hoſte, Sacrament, Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of Sacrament, Sacrifice, and ſuch other like: &amp; withall, you co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firme the expoſition which you haue made of them, to the ende no man ſhould thinke, that we had done you any wronge. But
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:19770:37"/>turne your ſelues which way you pleaſe; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret your body of Chriſt that is ſo conſumed and eaten with Miſe, Spiders, and Wormes, and brought to naught as it liketh you beſt. And yet if there were none other miſchiefe in all this your helliſh diuinitie, but your ſo vnreuerent ſpeaking of the moſt precious body of our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt, ſurely, you moſt horrible blaſphemours &amp; moſt deteſtable heretiques, are well worthy to fry the hugeſt &amp; moſt notable fagots that euer were in the world. And therefore now make ready your fagots and ſet them on a light fire, to burne and roſte vs withall, becauſe we will not beleue in your ſtraunge Gods, and ſtraunge Chriſtes, who ſuffer them ſelues to be deuoured of vermine, and periſh in their bellies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>b</hi> There are ſome of them that are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented that the mouſe or vermine which ſhalbe taken with the deede doing, be burnt, but giue commandement that it be firſt flead and puld in peeces, and make thereof a faire Anatomie, that they might plucke out ſuch part of the body as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth vndigeſt out of the belly and guttes. For, is not this traiterous vermine worthy to be quartered, as a traitour, and afterward burnt like an heretique?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>c</hi> This Ordenaunce of burning the vomit, is but to ſupply the wante, if there be none to be found that will eate it. Which without doubt they are very well worthy of, to the ende it might be truely ſaid of them, and without any maner of fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guratiue kind of ſpeach, The dogge is turned to

                  <hi>a</hi> BEcauſe the Prieſt prepareth him ſelfe to blaſpheme God, &amp; renounce Ieſus Chriſt by the ſaying of his Maſſe: he, for the putting him ſelfe into a good eſtate, for the performing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, beginneth with the moſt manifeſt blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies that may be againſt God and his Chriſt, to purge him of his ſinnes: as may appeare by the abſolution that is giuen him, wherein, the merite of Ieſus Chriſt is vtterly renounced: as oftentimes hath beene ſeene.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>b</hi> In this confeſſion, there are two perſons to play this enterlude, the one is the Confeſſour, and the other he that is confeſſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>c</hi> Who is able to fulfill this commandement, to number all his ſinnes?<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 19.</note> For it is written, who knoweth all the ſinnes which he hath committed? And therefore Dauid, who ſpake theſe words, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:19770:42"/>the Lorde to purge him from his ſecrete ſinnes, becauſe he knew that it was impoſſible for him to vnderſtand and knowe them, ſo farre was it of from him as to be able to number them all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>d</hi> The merite of the paſſion of Ieſus Chriſt is ſufficient for vs to obtaine pardon &amp; forgiueneſſe of our ſinnes at the hands of God, or elſe it is not. Nowe if it be not, then without all doubt Ieſus Chriſt is not Ieſus Chriſt, to wit, the verie true Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour &amp; Redeemer of the Soules of miſerable ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. And if he be ſufficient, whie then do theſe blaſphemers, adde in their fourme of abſolution, not only the ſuffrages of our mother holy Churh, but alſo the good deedes of him that maketh his confeſſion: attributing the remiſſion of his ſinnes as well vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as vnto the death of Ieſus Chriſt? What other meaning haue they then herein, but to make Ieſus Chriſt no alone Sauiour, but onelie an halfe Sauiour, or the thirde part of a Sauiour? And that we obtaine not remiſſion of our ſinnes, onely by his death, but partly by it, and partly by the ſuffrages of our mother holy Church (which as they tearme them, are called workes of ſupere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation) and partly by the good workes which we our ſelues may do. So that by this meane a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſhall not be beholden to Ieſus Chriſt, but for the thirde part of his ſaluation, and for the other thirde part, to the Church: by which is chieflie meant, the Prieſts, Monkes, and Friers, and that annointed rabble of ſhauelinges: &amp; by their ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frages and prayers, and for the laſt third part eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie man is to fetch it out of the ſhoppe of his owne
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:19770:43"/>workes. Thus here we ſee what honour theſe ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hominable blaſphemers giue vnto Ieſus Chriſt, and what meanes they vſe topurge them of their ſinnes, who confeſſe them ſelues vnto their ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable holineſſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>e</hi> In this place they take repentance for ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, by which they enioyne ſuch as they haue abſolued, that, which they here call, this &amp; this, to wit, whatſoeuer ſhall com in the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſors braine: who therwith againe addeth blaſphemy vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemie. For, for the firſt, that, which is enioyned him for penance, is taken to be a ſatisfaction for his ſinnes to God ward, which is againe ſet in the roome of the ſatisfaction of Ieſus Chriſt, or at the leaſt to ech it withall, to ſupply the wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that might be in him, to the end that Ieſus Chriſt ſhould not haue all the honor of being our onely Sauiour, but that one part therof might ſtil be atributed to our ſelues, &amp; to our own merits &amp; works. Which thing is expreſſed in that forme which is vſed at Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ua, in this manner. <hi>Pro poenitentia ſalutari, vos dice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis ter Pater noſter, vel facietis &amp;c. Iſta poenitentia &amp; meritum paſsionis Ieſu Chriſti, &amp; omnia bona per te facta &amp; facienda tibi valeant ad remiſsionem omnium peccatorum, &amp;c.</hi> That is to ſay, You ſhall ſay for your penance three Pater noſters, or do &amp;c. Let this penance, and the merite of the Paſſion of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, and all the good deedes which thou haſt alreadie done &amp; hereafter ſhalt do, be auaila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to thee for the remiſſion of thy ſinnes, &amp;c. And beſides, here is a worſe thing then all the reſt, That the works which they enioyne the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to do for
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:19770:43"/>ſuch their penance &amp; ſatisfaction, are either full of ſuperſtition &amp; idolatrie, or elſe manifeſt blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, as to babble and patter ouer certaine Pater noſters, &amp; Aue Maries, before idols, or elſe to offer vp candels vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſing Maſſes both for the quicke and dead, to go on pilgrimage to make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> buy bulles, &amp; other ſuch like traſh. Here we ſee after what ſort the popiſh Church vſeth to pay &amp; content God, as if a man ſhould ſatisfie the law, for a fault that he had committed againſt the ſame, in paying the penaltie that was ſet vpon his head by order of lawe, for his offence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>f</hi> Here good Maſt Confeſſor, is not contented to announce to the miſerable ſinner which hath confeſſed him ſelfe vnto him, abſolution &amp; remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his ſinnes, in the name of Ieſus Chriſt: But ſpeaketh like a Prince, as if Ieſus Chriſt could doe nothing without his Maſtſhip, ſaying, and I for my part, by mine abſolute authority do abſolue thee, &amp;c. And the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> forthwith concludeth moſt blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly, In the name of the Father, of the Sonne, &amp; of the holy Ghoſt, &amp;c.

<pb n="81" facs="tcp:19770:45"/>him that hath vowed to goe barefooted, to ſaye Maſſe vnſhodde. For, as they ſay, the Prieſt that ſayeth Maſſe, is likened to a man of warre, and a valiant Champion, who goeth to fight with the Deuill, in the defence of Chriſtians. And therfore it is meete that he ſhould be armed &amp; well furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed: for he hath to deale with a dangerous beaſt. And therefore the firſt thing that he muſt put on, muſt be hisſhooes, in ſteade of buskins of maile: which as they ſay, do ſignifie alſo the incarnation &amp; humility of Ieſus Chriſt.

And becauſe they would yet ſhewe them ſelues more horrible blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemers againſt it, they alleadge Saint Iohn Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt for the authour of this iollie miſticall expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, ſaying, that he ſo called it. Doeth not this deſerue burninge?

But let vs nowe leaue the feete, and come we to the head, whereon the Byſhop weareth an horned Myter in ſtead of an helmet &amp; Beurgonet, where a ſimple Prieſt hath nothing on but his coyfe &amp; a womans couerchefe: which ouer and beſides this, ſignifieth alſo accordinge to their expoſition, the wimple wherewith Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt his face was couered,<note place="margin">

<pb n="82" facs="tcp:19770:46"/>the Biſhops in verie deede, are a great deale more worthy to weare the miter, then the ſimple prieſts, becauſe it is a toke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of infamous &amp; pillary knights, as hath beene ſayed elſewhere, becauſe they are more abhominable then they. Becauſe they are the men which make the Prieſtes. And therefore when Iohn Hus was burnt at Conſtance, becauſe they meant to make a laughing ſtocke of him, &amp; declare him to be more infamous, they put a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per miter on his head, whereon two deuilles were pictured, and betweene them was written, <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiarcha,</hi> to wit, the Prince of hereſie. Thus here we ſee the true deuiſe agreeing not onely with Iohn Hus, the ſeruant of Ieſus Chriſt, but with the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops miters alſo, to the honouring of the order of Biſhops, with ſuch honour as belongeth vnto them. But let vs leaue nowe to ſpeake of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops miters, and of the Prieſtes coifes and ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chefes, and ſpeake of the reſt of the harneſſe of theſe villanouſe Champions. Where good labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers are wonted to caſt of their clothes when they go about their worke, for feare they ſhould be to hoate, the Biſhops and Prieſtes do cleane contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, putting garment vpon garment when as they go to worke. But here we muſt vnderſtande, that to make an amendes for that, they caſt of their clothes when they goe to meate: For, there they intende to play their part in good ſad earneſt, ſo that they will eate till they ſweate withall. But here, where they meane to mocke God and his people, they put their mothers ſmocke, which they call an Abue, vppon their gownes, which,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:19770:46"/>as they interprete it, is in ſtead of a ſhirt of maile, and therwith repreſenteth the gowne which He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rode gaue to Ieſus Chriſt in a mockerie. For, theſe peeces of harneſſe ioyne iumpe together. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the girdle wherewith he girdeth his ſmocke, doeth ſignifie the bowe, wherewith, theſe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers ſerue in this bloudie warre: and the ſcourge wherewith they ſcourged Chriſt: and the little corde, wherewith the ſtole is tyed to his girdle, ſignifieth the quiuer wherein to put the Arrowes. The ſtole, that is to ſaye, the breſt plate, which goeth about the necke, and is croſſed ouer the bellie like a Saint Andrewes croſſe, as the ſwad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling bandes of young children are, ſerueth for a launce to ſhake againſt the enemie: and alſo in ſteade of the corde wherewith Ieſus Chriſt was bound, when they ſcourged him. The manipule, that is to ſay, the young childes ſwadling bande, which is put about his arme as a braſelet, is his mace or courtelance: and the corde alſo where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with Ieſus Chriſtes handes were bound.

               <p>
                  <hi>c</hi> It was ordeined in the 2. Councell of Laodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cea,<note place="margin">La. Concil.</note> that many of the Pſalmes, and their verſicles, ſhould not be confounded one with an other: but be rehearſed in the ſelfe ſame forme and maner as the ſeruantes of God made them. Which orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance they of the popiſh church do worſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue in the Maſſe, then in any other place. For, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they confound pele mele for euery purpoſe, many of the verſicles which are taken out of the Pſalmes, as if they would make neither rime nor reaſon of them, or elſe they deuide a Pſalme, and take out of it certen verſicles which they mingle and remingle, &amp; ſo rehearſe them to no purpoſe, and without all reaſon, as eaſely may be iudged, by the ſight of this maner which is here vſed in their Maſſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>d</hi> I my ſelfe knew once a pariſh prieſt, who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer vnderſtood: either yet was able to pronounce, this <hi>Introibo,</hi> but alwayes ſaid, <hi>Et introibo adtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tara Dei:</hi> that is to ſay, I will go into the hell of God. In which ſaying, he deceaued not him ſelfe much. For, to take the Aultar in that ſence, which they of the popiſh church, here take it, and to do that which they do in it, is in very deede the hie way to hell: for aſmuch they forſake Ieſus Chriſt vpon it, by whome onely we are to be deliuered thence. And therefore there is good cauſe, why the prieſt looketh downeward, bowing him ſelfe
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:19770:52"/>to the ground, as a man that had quite and cleane forgotten heauen, yea and his owne nature alſo wherein God created him, and as if he were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a very beaſt, touching his ſmeller downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, according to the maner which the Poete here writeth of,<note place="margin">Ouid.

                  </note> and in the ſame ſence as it is here ſet downe in Engliſh.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>And though that euery liuing thing</l>
                  <l>His eyes to ground is made to caſte</l>
                  <l>Yet God, mans face hath ſet ſhining</l>

               <p>But this our maiſter Aſſe driuer, leaueth loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vp into heauen, and ſtoupeth to the ground, whereof he is more carefull, then of heauen. But if he did this in humbleneſſe of minde and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triteneſſe of heart for his ſinnes, as the miſerable Publicane did, there were great reaſon in it. But I thinke him farre enough of from that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>e</hi> This verſicle is taken out of another Pſalme, and not out of the former, which manifeſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teruaileth the confeſſion that the prieſt anonafter maketh.<note place="margin">

<pb n="96" facs="tcp:19770:53"/>him ſelfe, to all the men &amp; woman ſaintes. For he thinketh it not enough to confeſſe him ſelfe to God alone, with whom al the Patriarches, Prophetes, &amp; Apoſtles were very well contented.</p>

For, euery of them putteth in whom ſoeuer pleaſeth them, but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially their Patrons, and ſuch as they haue a moſt ſingular deuotion vnto. It is eaſely alſo, by this forme and maner, to be iudged, that this enterlude is not fit to be playd, without there be moe then one perſon with the prieſt at Maſſe: becauſe it is an enterlude that requiteth many.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>b</hi> After that this blaſphemour hath diſgorged a cart loode full of blaſphemies againſt God, he then calleth vpon him for helpe: and forthwith he againe returneth to blaſpheme both him, and
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:19770:55"/>the virgine Mary alſo, calling vpon her in ſtead of Ieſus Chriſt. Hereby we may vnderſtand, that a man may iudge of what ſoeuer is in the Maſſe, that is taken out of the holy Scriptures, ſeeing it is entermedled with as infinite a nomber of bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphemies, as good &amp; holſome meate is entermed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with poiſon. Wherefore, it is ſo farre of that that which ſeemeth to be good, is not there made any whit the better, but rather become a great deale more deteſtable, for ſo much as the word &amp; name of God, &amp; of the men &amp; women Saintes are therin more profaned &amp; blaſphemed. And againe, we ſe moreouer what a mixture of ſondry peeces is here heaped vp together to &amp; fro without any iudgement in the world, and without following any one certaine text of any certaine matter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>c</hi> Why hath the prieſt here a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement to buzze the two prayers enſuing ſoftly &amp; ſecretly? For this is manifeſtly againſt the Statutes and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of the councell of Baſile, by which is ordei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that the prieſts are to be reproued and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected which ſay Maſſe with ſecret prayers, &amp; ſo low vowed, as that they which are preſent and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them, cannot heare what they ſay: By which alſo all they are condemned, who either mumble vp or curtall their wordes either in their Maſſe or canonicall Howres, and do not ſo diſtinctly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as that euery one may well vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d what they ſay. For if theſe prayers whereof we now ſpeake be ſuch as in deede they ought to be, why the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> pronounce they them not rather a lowd that euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may heare them, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mumble them
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:19770:55"/>vp in their teeth as they do? Eſpecially ſeeing they pronounce the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not particularly to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues, but generally to all thoſe which are at Maſſe, to the end that all they might be alſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehended and wrapped, within the horrible blaſphemies in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> conteined? Wherefore it is no maruell though he mumble the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vp ſecretly, as if it were a charme, and ſtowp downe with his head &amp; backe, ſtill looking to the ground: for he is not worthy to lift vp his head to heauen ſtained it with ſuch blaſphemies. For, as for the firſt point, that which is called <hi>Sa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cta Sa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ctoru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> that is to ſay, the holy of holy ones, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he ſpeaketh, to go into, is not the ſame which God ordeined by Moſes,<note place="margin">

For there is neuer a man that hath deſerued more to go into hell, &amp; into the infernal ſanctuary of Satan, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he: And there is none other meane to go into the sa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ctuary of Ieſus Chriſt, which is hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, ſaue onely by his merites, wherof there is no
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:19770:56"/>more mention here made, then in the prayer fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, wherin he craueth not onely pardon for his ſinnes of all the Saintes in generall, but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of thoſe, whoſe reliques are in the place where he him ſelfe is, as if in them were more ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, then in any of the reſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>d</hi> And as for the reliques which are here ſpoken of, we are to remember what was ſaid heretofore, of the churches which were built in ſuch places as the ſepulchres, reliques, and commemorations of the Martyres were. And becauſe that many Aul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars and chapelles were here and there built &amp; ſet vp a broad in the countrey, there to celebrate the remembraunce of the Martyres: ſoone after that this cuſtome was receaued, it was ordeined by the firſt Councell of Carthage,<note place="margin">Ex Libr. Con.</note> ſolemnized about the dayes of Pope Anaſtaſe that the Biſhops might pull downe, all the Aultars and chappelles, that ſhould be ſet vp in any places where before time had not bene, ſome ſepulchers, reliques, houſes, places of reſorte, or ſome memoriall of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs: or if they could not do it without mouing of ſome commotion, yet that they might at the leaſt, forbid all Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to haunt any ſuch places. And for this cauſe was it afterward ordeined by the Councell of Epanuenſe which was ſolemniſed in the time of Gelaſius the firſt,<note place="margin">Ex Lib. Con.</note> that no Aultar ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it were of ſtone, &amp; had alſo ſome reliques of the Saintes, ſhould be anointed and conſecrated with Creſme. And becauſe they could not find places ynow wherein to ſet vp ſo many churches and aultars as they would, they were faine to bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:19770:56"/>them in other places, or elſe make and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfet them as they luſted. Wherefore it is enough for them at this preſent, to put into the bowels of the Aultar when it is conſecrated &amp; dedicated, in at an hole which is made in the middeſt thereof, called by them a Sepulcher, the ſmalleſt peeces of reliques that may be, locked vp in ſome prety coffer, with three graynes of frankinſence. And it is out of all doubt, that they may call this hole, a Sepulcher: bycauſe forſoothe it is made to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the Sepulchers of the Martyres, for, they are not there in deede, but by imagination, as thoſe which the Heathen made, called Cenotaphion, becauſe they were empty, and had no bodyes bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in them. And to the ende that theſe ſepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers ſhould not ſeeme to be altogether in vaine, they make men beleue that they haue put cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tein peeces of reliques into them. But the Lord knoweth and ſeeth what great deceit is in them, and what reliques they thruſt into them. We that haue ſeene theſe abhominable Aultars puld downe, can teſtifie what great villaines haue bene found within theſe ſepulchers of the Aul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars, and what notable knaueries haue bene diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered in theſe iolly workes. But our aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries will not beleue vs herein, becauſe they thinke vs to be parciall: howbeit we haue no ſuch meaning, for, they them ſelues maye ſee it by experience aſwell as we, and may alſo te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie and vnderſtand whether we lye or ſaye true. But admit that theſe were the verie true reliques of the Martyres, yet ſhall they be neuer
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:19770:57"/>able to excuſe them ſelues of the Idolatrie &amp; bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphemies which they commit in theſe thinges.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>e</hi> It is no maruell although this Shaueling, kiſſe the talbe wheron he meaneth to breake his faſt, and his paten, and ſawcer alſo, and that he like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe maketh ſtrong parfumes: for theſe thinges I tell you make him both faire and fat.</p>

They ſay that this ſignifieth Ieſus Chriſt comming out of the wombe of the Virgine, as a
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:19770:58"/>bridegrome that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth out of his chamber. For queſtionleſſe this trickſie Sir Iohn, is a pleaſaunt bridegrome, and ioly minion, apparelled &amp; gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed like a comly paramour to go to a wedding</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>b</hi> See here what a ioly entry he maketh. He hath fed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſaith this gentle Sir Iohn, &amp; his quereſters alſo ſing the very ſame introite, very chauntingly. But what is this food, &amp; thoſe whom it doth feed? Forſooth the foode which Dauid ſpake of,<note place="margin">

Wherin they haue no whit ſaid amiſſe. For, to ſay truely, this is a God which throughly feedeth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with the pure fineſſe of the wheat, &amp; with all ſweet, pleaſant, &amp; delicate food. For, if there be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good &amp; pleaſant diſh to be had in al the world, it is kept for their kitchin &amp; boord. I reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we were yo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g boys, we were told, becauſe we ſhold be the more deſirous to ſtudy, that we might be made Prieſtes, that when we were Prieſtes we ſhould eate white bread. But becauſe this introite is a ſentence gelt out of a Pſalme, it hath no full ſenſe with it. Neither is it taken in this place, in ſuch ſenſe as it is ſet down in the Pſalme. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if we will expound it, and giue it the moſt fit ſenſe to the matter wheru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>to it is applied, we may thus interprete it, He, that is to ſay, the caky God of the Maſſe: hath fedde them, to wit, the Prieſts: with the fineſſe of the wheate, and honie of the Rocke: that is to ſay, verie fat, with the beſt and
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:19770:59"/>moſt delicate foode. And therefore haue they ſo great a mind, &amp; are alwayes ſo ready to ſing dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble &amp; treble Alleluyas, which are meary and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant notes. For this I tell you is no melancholique or ſad feaſt. And for this cauſe are all the ſtreetes ſtrewed ouer with herbs, flours, &amp; greene boughs, &amp; behoong with Arras and tapeſtrie, and withall the braueſt orname<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts that may be hanged abroad, and eſpeciallie, when this iolie white God is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried about on proceſſion, he is then accompanied with notable muſicall inſtruments, with goodlie tapers and torch ſtaues: and both he him ſelfe, and they which beare him, &amp; as manie as accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie him, are receaued with maruelous pleaſant paſtimes, enterludes, moriſdaunces, and with all the ſports that may be deuiſed: and this is to make him amends for the ſtraight impriſonment which he endureth all the reſt of the yeare.</p>

For, we ſe by this ſelfe ſame order, which is at this day obſerued in the Maſſe, that the doctrine of the Apoſtles &amp; Euangeliſts, is preferred before pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: by which, as well the people as the Miniſters of the Church, ought to prepare them ſelues for this doctrine, the one of them to teach it, and the other to heare and vnderſtand it. And therefore, manie ordinances were made by the Councelles,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:19770:62"/>appertaining to this matter, as well for the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Church, as for the people. And for the firſt it was decreed by the fourth Councel of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage,<note place="margin">Ex lib. Con.</note> That whatſoeuer they were that went out of the Church and auditory, whiles the Prieſt was preaching of the word of God vnto the people, ſhould be excommunicated: neither were there any forbidden to heare or come into the Church, were they heathen, Iewes, or heretiques, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto the Maſſe of the Catechumeni, whereof we haue ſpoken elſewhere. And to th'end that the people ſhould neuer be without this food: It was alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed by the councell of Arles, ſolemnized in the dayes of Charlemaine, That the Prieſts ſhould not preach onely in cities,<note place="margin">Ex lib.

And at the Councell of Tours, holden alſo in the dayes of the ſaid Charlemaine: the Biſhops the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned to do it, &amp; to haue Homilies: that is to ſay, Sermons containing neceſſarie doctrine, for the inſtruction of the people, but eſpeciallie concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the principall pointes of Chriſtian religion: and thoſe to be verie familiar &amp; meete for the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitie &amp; groſſe vnderſtanding of the ſimple peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: and to that ende were they tranſlated into a tongue, wherein euerie man might beſt vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand them. By the like reaſon ar the Biſhops com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded to ſtudie diligently the holy Scriptures, but eſpecially the holy Euangeliſts, &amp; Pauls Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, &amp; to be ſo familiarly acquainted with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as that they might haue them by heart: and ſtudy

And for the eſtabliſhing of a verie good order, that no want ſhould be founde herein, it was againe decreed in the firſt Councell of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonce, celebrated in the yeare 813. That the Biſhoppes ſhould perfourme this duetie in theyr owne perſonnes, except they were ſicke, not at home, or elſe were withdrawn by ſome neceſſary buſineſſe: and that in ſuch caſes, they ſhould haue meete men to do it in their ſteades, to the ende the people might neuer be without a Sermon vppon the Sondaye, nor vppon anie holye dayes. The Councell of Rheims celebrated about the tyme of Pope Leo the thirde,<note place="margin">Ex lib.

Con.</note> Moreouer, it was ordained in the Lateran Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, ſolemnized in the dayes of Innocent the 3. in the yeare 1215. that in thoſe cities and cuntries where there were people of ſundrie languages, &amp; had ſundrie ceremonies, and faſhions in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of God, and yet were of one faith and of one religion, that they all ſhould be prouided of meet men to ſay their ſeruice, and adminiſter the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and to teach them alſo both by worde and example, according to their faſhions &amp; language. The like alſo was ordained concerning the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of Biſhoppes, and the aide that they ſhould haue, if they could not preach being withdrawne therefrom vpon lawfull cauſes, or were not them ſelues alone able to do it: And then it is eftſoones ſaid, that they ſhall in no wiſe be borne withall, who by reaſon of ignorance are not able to do it. Wherupon it was likewiſe eſtabliſhed, that there ſhould be appointed learned diuines, to teach the Prieſtes and the reſt, and Maiſters alſo to inſtruct the poore, without wages, to the ende the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches ſhould not be vnprouided of Paſtors, to feed them with ſpirituall foode,<note place="margin">Ex lib.

               <p>THere was mention made in the Councell of Rheimes which wee earſt alleadged,<note place="margin">Ex lib. Con.</note> of the charge that was giuen to the Subdeacons for the reading of the Epiſtle before all men, and to the Deacon, for the reading of the Goſpell, for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the faithfull. And in the Councell of Vale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, holden in Spaine, about the dayes of Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach or Hormiſd,<note place="margin">Ex lib. Con.</note> it was decreed that the Goſpell ſhould be read after the Epiſtle: that is to ſay, after Paules Epiſtles: Becauſe there was a time, when as the Maſſe began with the Epiſtle, as elſewhere hath bin ſaid, and that they read nothing elſe in it, but the Epiſtles of the Apoſtles, and after the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the Goſpelles. And therefore it was ordained in the ſame Councell, that according to the ancient Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, &amp; cuſtome of the auncient Church, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell ſhould be read after the reſt of the leſſons, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of th'Epiſtles of the Apoſtles, in the Maſſe of the Catechumeni, before the offertorie of the faithfull: to th'end that the faithful who taried lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g at the diuine ſeruice, might be inſtructed as wel by reading of the ſaid leſſons, as by the ſermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s which the Biſhops &amp; prieſts made on them, but alſo the

And the cauſe of this ordinance is there rendred. It is, ſaid they, becauſe that we haue found by experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny by this meane haue bin conuerted to the faith, after they had once hard the doctrine. Wherin we haue againe a very euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t teſtimony of that which hath bene ſaid, as well of the preaching, as alſo of the diuine ſeruice, which in the auncient time of the Church was ſaid in a la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>guage that all men vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood. For, if it had bene deliuered in an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowen tong, they which ar here ſpoken of, had not bin conuerted, neither had it ſo falle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as the holy Apoſtle him ſelf ſaith it falleth out with the verie infidelles,<note place="margin">1, <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.</note> when they come into the Church, &amp; heare &amp; vnderſtand the doctrine that is there handled. Their hart, ſaith he, is touched ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, &amp; they right well know that God is in them whome they heare ſo ſpeake, but contrariwiſe, it had fallen out otherwiſe with them, then as the ſame Apoſtle ſaith it fell out, if they which ſpake, had ſpoken in an vnknowen toung. They would haue thought, ſaith he, that you had byn fooles &amp; mad men. Moreouer, becauſe there were ſome, then in thoſe dayes which entermedled ſongs, &amp; Pſalmes, betweene the reading of the Epiſtle and Goſpell,<note place="margin">Ex lib. Con.</note> it is ſaid in the decrees of the 4. Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Tolede, celebrated about the time of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norius
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:19770:64"/>the firſt, that it is contrarie to the auncient Cannons, and auncient cuſtome of the Church. Wherefore it is forbidden vpon paine of excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication that it be no more ſo done, but that thoſe prayers, ſongs, &amp; Pſalmes ſhall be reſerued to be ſaid or ſong after the reading of the Goſpel, to the end the order be not marred, but that the doctrine ſhall be preferred in his place, without confuſion. Wherein appeareth, that whatſoeuer is nowe in the Maſſe, betweene the Epiſtle &amp; the Goſpell, to wit, the Reſponſe and Graduell, the Tracts, Alleluya, and proſe, haue bene added to the Maſſe, as well againſt the ordinaunce of this Councell, as alſo of the reſt of the ancient Cano<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, by it alleadged. But it is no maruell although that this ordinance hath not taken any great effect, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that the cuſtome of reading and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the Epiſtle and Goſpell in a tong which all men vnderſtand, hath bene vtterly aboliſhed in the Maſſe, wherefore there is no daunger in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding both of order and doctrine, whereas is neither order nor doctrine, but altogether ſhame and confuſion. I haue of ſet purpoſe handled theſe matters in this place ſomewhat with the largeſt, (albeit I haue alreadie ſpoken ſome thing of them hertofore) to the end that euery man may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, what inſtruction there is in this part of the Maſſe, called ſo by that name.

For, for the firſt, to what purpoſe is this here put in? Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For, That which I receaued of the Lord. &amp;c. Whervnto is this, For, referred? wherfore re<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dreth he a reaſon: conſidering that there is nothing go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before, that ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be referred to any thing which may any way ſerue the turne, for the matter that S.

               <p>
                  <hi>b</hi> S.

<pb n="122" facs="tcp:19770:66"/>ſhal we think of the forgers of the Maſſe, of whom we haue heretofore ſpoken, who thereby, haue ſo blemiſhed the ſupper of the Lord, as that they haue vtterly ouerthrowen &amp; aboliſhed it? whom then ſhould we not aſſueredly follow,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.</note> either S.

               <p>
                  <hi>c</hi> S. Mark, in his 14. Ch. ſayth, that he bleſſed, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring therby, that to bleſſe, &amp; giue tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kes, is here taken to be alone, as hath ben ſay in other places.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>d</hi> This breaking declareth, that this bread ought to be diſtributed, as it is here.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>e</hi> He eateth it not alone as the prieſt doth, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth he worſhip it, or yet putteth it into a pixe, to cary about on proceſſion, &amp; to carry here &amp; there to be worſhipped, or to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>iure tempeſtes: but co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandeth it to be taken, &amp; eftſoones eaten.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>f</hi> We haue heretofore ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dled this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to teach vs in what ſence theſe words are to be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; how thoſe words alſo are to be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which follow the cup diſh, ouer and beſides that, which we at larg haue write<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; diſputed vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in the booke of the Miniſtery of the word of God, &amp; of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments. And therfore we will here only ſay, and not deny but that the very body and blood of our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt, is truly deliuered vnto all the faithful, in the ſupper, by an inuiſible power of the holy Ghoſt, ſpiritually, &amp; to the ſpirituall &amp; rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate man, which receaueth it by faith, &amp; is ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:19770:66"/>ſpiritually fed in a ſpirituall life, as the body receaueth the material bread, &amp; is therwith fed in a corporal life, but that there is no alteratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the ſubſtance in either of both, neither yet any natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and material coniunction betwene the bread and wine, and the body and blood of Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>g</hi> There is in S. Paules wordes, according to the Greeke, which is broken for you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>h</hi> He ſayeth not, Do ye this as a ſacrifice, for the redemption of the ſoules, both of the quicke and dead: but that we ſhould do that which he did, &amp; cauſed to be done in the Supper, &amp; not that which he did on the croſſe, wheron he offred a ſacrifice for the redemption of our ſoules, which is ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for vs, &amp; can be done by none other, nor in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place, neither yet by any other meane, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the Supper is a reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance, &amp; no ſacrifice, but much leſſe a Maſſe: for it is neither the one, nor yet the other, becauſe they would make it that which it cannot be. For, it cannot be this ſacrifice, if it be not Ieſus Chriſt him ſelfe, who offred him ſelfe, in that ſorte that he was offred: And if that be it, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> without doubt, Ieſus the ſon of God ceaſeth to be.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>i</hi> If the Romaniſtes would ſtrictly, &amp; according to the letter, preſſe the words of our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt, which he ſpake concerning the body and blood of the Supper, we may alſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude by the ſame reaſons, that the cup is likewiſe the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, confirmed by the blood of Ieſus Chriſt, and not the blood it ſelfe, according to the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of Saint Paule and Saint Luke,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. <hi>Luke</hi> 12.</note> who both vſe the very ſelfe ſame wordes therein.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>k</hi> This is to declare that which he ſaid: Do ye this: that is to ſay, eate this bread, and drinke this wine in remembrance of me, as I haue appointed you: which thing the Apoſtle manifeſtly expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth immediatly after, both of the one &amp; the other without any deuiding of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as they of the romiſh church deuide the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the people.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>l</hi> This expoundeth what it is to celebrate this remembrance of Ieſus Chriſt, for the which the Supper was inſtituted. He ſayeth not, As aften as ye ſhall offer this bread, &amp; this cup, you ſhal make a ſacrifice of the body and blood of the Lord.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>m</hi> This accordeth with the teſtimony which the Angels gaue vnto the Apoſtles that day that Ieſus Chriſt aſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded,<note place="margin">

                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> corporally, in fleſh blood &amp; bones, &amp; came into the prieſts handes in that behalfe, to be made a ſacrifice, &amp; afterward, to be really &amp; in deede eaten by him, as they of the popiſh church vnderſtand it: But declareth, that he is in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in his natural body, from whence we muſt looke for him, to come to iudge the quicke &amp; the dead, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the wordes of the articles of our Faith: And that in the meane while, we ſhould here ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate the remembrance of him, thereby to giue him thankes, &amp; that we might alwayes more and more aſſure our ſelues of his promiſes, &amp; that we are in him and he in vs, through the power of the faith which we haue in him, &amp; of the holy Ghoſt, by whoſe power he dwelleth in vs.</p>
               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:19770:67"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>n</hi> Here, S. Paule, after the pronouncing of the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tall wordes, calleth the bread &amp; wine, the ſignes of the Supper, &amp; not the body and blood.<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.</note> Which thing was not done, without the aſſuered councell of the ſpirite of God. For, although they of the Romiſh church, excuſe this maner of ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, in their expoſitions, to the end it ſhould not encounter with their tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſubſtantiatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: yet ſhould they haue had a farre greater aduauntage, if Saint Paule had rather vſed the name of the body and blood, then of the name of bread and cuppe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>o</hi> They receaue it vnworthely, which receaue it to any other ende, and in any other ſorte then the Lord hath appointed it. Wherefore, all they of the Romiſh church, but eſpecially all the prieſtes cannot receaue it but vnworthely.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>p</hi> The greatneſſe of the offence which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by his vnworthineſſe, ought to make all men a feard. For, it is aſmuch as they ſhould ſell, betray, &amp; crucifie Ieſus Chriſt which, all they do,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Hebr.</hi> 6.</note> as the Apoſtle witneſſeth, that abuſe his benefit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>q</hi> He ſayeth not, let euery man proue him ſelfe with a prieſt, or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe all his ſinnes to him alone, when as he is of the yeares of diſcretio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, at the leaſt once a yeare at Eaſter: and that he endeuour him withall his might, to acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pliſh the penance which is enioined him, vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> paine to be driuen out of the church all the dayes of his life, and to be depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of buriall after his death: as Innoce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t the third ordeined in the Laterane Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cel,<note place="margin">Ex libr. Con.</note> which we haue already ſpoken of: But his meaning is, that euery man ſhould proue him ſelfe, becauſe that he is not
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:19770:68"/>capable to receaue the Supper who cannot ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue him ſelfe, after this rule of Saint Paule. And therefore, in the old time, the Catechumeni were not receaued hereunto, neither yet at this day, are young boyes and girles, vntill ſuch time as they are inſtructed and taught to do it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>r</hi> He now ſetteth downe the horribleneſſe of the puniſhment, to the ende that they which will not tremble at the greuouſneſſe of the deede, ſhould at the leaſt feare the greatneſſe of the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>h</hi> We are not by this therefore to ſay, that this bread is the naturall body of Ieſus Chriſt: but that he doth him as great wrong, as if he violated his very body, for aſmuch as he profaneth &amp; blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth it aſmuch as in him lyeth, becauſe that through his infidelity, vnworthines, &amp; vntha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, he maketh no more accompt of it, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> if there were no more difference betwene the body of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, and another mans, and that the Supper were no better, then a profane banket. Moreouer, although I haue, ſomewhat at large, handled all theſe matters in other places &amp; bookes, yet haue I thouhgt good to touch this matter a litle by the way, thereby to let the Romaniſtes vnderſtand, by the text of the Epiſtle which they ſing in this Maſſe, how ſufficient it is to ouerthrow not onely all their corpus Chriſti Feaſt, and all the idolatrie therein committed, but alſo all their Maſſes, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions, and mens traditions, which are manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt the word of God, or that haue no ſuer foundation therein.

Wherfore, it is forbidden, any more ſo to be dealt withall, vpon paine, that who ſoeuer doeth it, ſhalbe diſcharged of his office. And becauſe, that this time, wherein this Maſſe is to be celebrated, is a time of ioye, and chiefly for the prieſtes, for the reaſons afore ſaid, it is ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnely ſong in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>c</hi> It is to no purpoſe to alleage here the place of S. Iohn, as it is alleaged: becauſe it hath no full ſence in it, neither doth it any whit agree with that that goeth before, neither yet with that that followeth. Moreouer, it is ſo often repeated in this peece, as that they ſet it downe for their Goſpell. But if they ſay it once, it is enough for them, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be to purpoſe or not, conſidering that their mouthes runne ouer, with ſo much ſpeaking of fleſh and blood, of meat and drinke, and of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and boire.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>a</hi> BEcauſe the Proſe &amp; Sequence that is ſaid in this Maſſe, is very long, I haue only here ſet downe about the one halfe thereof, in ſuch forme and maner, as that a man may the eaſelier iudge of the reſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>b</hi> That which we receaue ſo often heard out
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:19770:70"/>of Saint Paule, is comprehended within this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement, wherein is ſaid, that Ieſus Chriſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to miniſter the Supper in ſuch forme and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and to ſuch an ende as he him ſelfe had leaft them an example. How then durſt theſe falſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes be ſo bold as to alter and ouerthrow this holy ordinance, with this patched inuention of theirs in the Maſſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>c</hi> Seeing then that Ieſus Chriſt hath taught vs how to deale in the Supper, where will this ſlibber Gibber find in the inſtitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> therof, that he ordei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the conſecration of the bread and wine, to be made an hoſte for ſaluation: that is to ſay, a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to obtaine ſaluation therby? For, an hoſt, doth not fignify ſuch a round white cake as that which they call an hoſte in the Maſſe, and as the ſimple ſo thinke of it: But ſignifieth that which is ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed, &amp; the very ſacrifice it ſelfe. And for aſmuch as the prieſts, take the Maſſe to be ſuch a ſacrifice, as wherein they ſacrifice Ieſus Chriſt with their owne handes: they call this white round cake the hoſte, which they take to be Ieſus Chriſt, becauſe they meane to ſacrifice him, &amp; offer him vp. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the ſupper was not ordeined for this purpoſe, but contrary wiſe to admoniſh vs that there was none other ſacrifice, but that which Ieſus Chriſt made vpon the croſſe, which could not be by any meanes againe ſacrificed: but, that that, was the remembrance of this ſacrifice. And taking this name of the hoſte in this ſence, the wine which they alſo offer for the blood of Ieſus Chriſt, ſhould be an hoſte likewiſe, aſwell as the bread, although
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:19770:71"/>it be not ſo called. Againe, neither ſhould the litle round Robins which are deliuered to the people in the adminiſtration of the Supper, nor yet the great ones that are kept in the pixe, or ſhrine (as the holy hoſte of Dijon, and ſuch like) be any hoſtes, becauſe that they are not offred vp, nor ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed as that is, which is in the Maſſe. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore euen by their owne doctrine and practiſe, they do miſterme them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>d</hi> Where find they me againe this inſtruction, whereby Chriſtians are taught, that the bread is the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> no more bread, when as the prieſt hath brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed ouer it, and hudled vp certaine wordes in ſo doing, but very fleſh: &amp; the wine likewiſe no more wine, but euen very blood? For, that which is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in this complement, that the bread is turned into fleſh, and the wine into blood, ſignifieth the ſelfe ſame, which the author himſelfe ſayth in the hymne at eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſong in the ſaid feaſt, in theſe words,</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Verbum caro, panem verum,</l>
                  <l>Verbo carnem efficit:</l>
                  <l>Fitque ſanguis Chriſtimerum.</l>
                  <l>Et ſi ſenſus deficit,</l>
                  <l>Ad firmandum cor ſyncerum,</l>
                  <l>Sola fides ſufficit.</l>
               </q>
               <p>That is to ſay,</p>
               <p>The word fleſh, maketh the true bread fleſh by the word: &amp; the wine, is made the blood of Chriſt, although the ſence ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not perceaue it. And for the ſtrengthning of a ſincere hart, faith only ſufficeth. This laſt ſentence is very true, if it be applied to a true faith, founded vpon the pure &amp; clere word of God as ſhall more at large hereafter be ſpoken.
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:19770:71"/>But the firſt is a ſentence altogether againſt the ſence which they here take it for, not onely of the pure word of God, but alſo of the nature of all the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts (which ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be no ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, if they haue not the true ſignes in them, &amp; the things alſo that are ſignified by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) &amp; likewiſe againſt the, iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the auncie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Church: as hath bene declared by the words of Ireneus: yea &amp; alſo againſt the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry doctrine of Popiſh tranſubſtantiatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For, they which are the vpholders therof, dare not the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues affirme, that the bread and wine are changed into the very ſubſtaunce of the body and blood of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, by reaſon of the great abſurdities that would enſue vpon this opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: as hath bene by vs already ſomwhat largely handled, in the booke of the Miniſtery of the word of God, &amp; of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. And therefore they had rather ſay that the ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the bread &amp; wine is nothing, &amp; cleane vaniſhed away, &amp; the body &amp; blood of the Lord to become in place. It muſt not be ſaid then that the bread is become fleſh, that is to ſay, tranſlated into fleſh: or goeth for fleſh, &amp; ſo giueth it place: But rather that fleſh becometh bread, &amp; that the ſubſtance of bread giueth it place, &amp; lodgeth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his accidentes. The like is alſo of the wine and blood. We ſee now the certainty that is in this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and what a notable foundation it hath.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>e</hi> Although faith beholdeth thinges which can not be ſeene with the bodely eyes, nor yet percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by mans raiſon: yet is it neither bleareyed nor blind, to ſuffer it ſelfe to be lead as a young child that is without iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, who is eaſely made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:19770:72"/>that bladders are lanternes, and what ſoeuer elſe it ſeeth, or like vnto old fooliſh doting wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> who lightly beleue what ſoeuer fooliſh thing is tould them, or like brute beſtes who are eaſely led in a ſtring. For, faith, looketh into the word of God with her ſpiritually eyes: wherein ſhe beholdeth &amp; vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth as it were in a glaſſe, thoſe things which God ſheweth &amp; manifeſteth vnto her, which mans reaſon is neuer able to vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d nor co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>he<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d by the light of nature, without it be regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted &amp; renued by the ſpirit of God: &amp; what ſoeuer faith ſeeth in this glaſſe, is a great deale more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that which the body ſeeth with his eyes or that ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s reaſon is able to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d or perceiue with al her natural ſenſes. But, as it ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be faith, without it be firſt grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the word of God: ſo likewiſe can it ſee no whit, but in this glaſſe, wherin God manifeſteth &amp; repreſenteth himſelfe vnto it. But the faith of the Romaniſts, which Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas of Aquine maketh ſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtant in this Proſe, is a bleareyed &amp; blind faith, and altogether brutiſh, which ſuffreth it ſelfe to be lead by the blind, the leaders of the blind, as one that is blind her ſelf: &amp; by beaſtes, as a miſerable brute beaſt, which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth others. For, where is this glaſſe of Gods word, wherein it beholdeth that, which Thomas ſayth it beleueth, &amp; ſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly kepeth in hart, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:19770:72"/>muſt alſo be ouerthrowen, &amp; Ieſus Chriſt robbed of his humaine nature, &amp; the whole order which God hath placed in his church by his word, &amp; the very true nature of the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts likewiſe. Wherefore it is greater reaſon to call their faith, which follow the Popiſh church, &amp; go to worke thus aduenturouſly &amp; blokiſhly, rather a raſh and arrogant faith, then a firme and conſtant faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>f</hi> Let vs ſee now what it is that they ſay is here done ouer &amp; beyond all order of nature. It is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth, that accidents of bread &amp; wine do here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine, and yet without ſubſtance either of bread or wine: and contrarywiſe, that the body &amp; blood of Ieſus Chriſt is here, without the accidentes and qualities of bread and wine. Wherefore, by theſe kindes &amp; ſignes, they vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the accide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts and qualities of bread &amp; wine: &amp; by the thinges, vnder which theſe excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t thinges are hidden, they vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, the ſubſtance of them: &amp; by theſe hidden thinges, the body and blod of Ieſus Chriſt, which are in very ſubſtance, vnder the ſhew of bread &amp; wine, and not vnder the bread &amp; wine it ſelfe, but vnder a falſe ſhew of them: ſo that the bread and wine wich they ſee there, are not there: but the body and blood which is not ſeene there, and wherof is no ſhew in the whole world.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>g</hi> Although the body, according to their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is vnder the kindes of bread: and the blood vnder the kindes of wine: yet we muſt not beleue forſooth, that they are ſeparated one from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: but that the body is aſwell vnder the kind of wine as the blood: and the blood vnder the kind
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:19770:73"/>of bread, as the body. Thus we ſee the body and blood ſeparated, and yet for all that they are not ſeparated. And no more is it in deede, if this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, be ſpiritually taken, as it is conuenient it ſhould be. But to take it corporally &amp; naturally as they take it, it ſerueth to no purpoſe, except they deale with brute beaſtes, who are contented, that my maiſters the Sophiſters, ſorcerers, &amp; coniurers haue ſaid that it is ſo, although they haue no na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall ground for it, nor yet any ground out of the word of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>h</hi> Let them here conſider vpon that which we haue already ſaid, when we ſpake of the brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the hoſte, and agree therunto, with Beren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers honorable amendes and adiuration.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>i</hi> Either the body of Ieſus Chriſt is not a true naturall body, or elſe this cannot be, which is here ſaid, taking it corporally and naturally, and not ſpiritually. For, as Saint Auguſtine ſayeth, we right well know that this grace is not conſumed by peece meale.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>k</hi> This is falſe, if it be vnderſtood not onely of the ſignes, but alſo of the thinges ſignified. For as it hath bene already ſhewed by the wordes of S. Auguſtine, that Ieſus Chriſt, his fleſh, &amp; blood, ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> neuer be receaued but vnto ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; not to da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: and yet forſooth the ſignes may: But it is not becauſe Ieſus Chriſt is receaued with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is not receaued with them. For, if he, were receaued, then that would follow which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed by the receauing of him, and which hath ſo often bene ſaid in the Alleluya, and which ſhalbe
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:19770:73"/>ſaid in the Goſpell following. The receauing then of the faithfull and vnfaithfull is not alike. For, the faithfull receaueth the ſigne and the thing ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, &amp; the vnfaithfull receaueth nothing ſaue the ſigne onely, although he be at the ſelfe ſame ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, &amp; receaueth the ſelfe ſame Sacrament of the ſelfe ſame Miniſter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>l</hi> They which beleeue this ſo monſtrous do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, ar not without cauſe admoniſhed that they ſtagger not. For to ſay truely, they muſt be verie dronke, &amp; more ſenſleſſe then brute beaſts. Now, as they would make men beleeue, that the bread is chaunged into a bodie, &amp; the wine into blood, and yet the one fully and wholly in the other, as well as if it were all one: Euen ſo likewiſe would they make men beleeue, that although they haue deuided their rou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d cake into many peeces (which is the bodie of their Chriſt.) Yet that there is as much ſubſtance in one of the peeces as was in the whole cake. But I do beleeue, that if they ſhould come to the partition of an inheritaunce of lande, which wholy appertained vnto them, it would be a very hard matter to make them receiue &amp; allow this philoſophie: and make them agree, that there were as much in one peece of it, as in the totall. They would therein be as greatly troubled as the Curate was who expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded this text, That to loue God with all his hart, ſignified, with the greater part, when as his pariſhioners told him, that they would, according to that expoſition, demaunde their part of the Curate. For although he ſaid, that it was all his, yet notwithſtanding, that it ought to
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:19770:74"/>be vnderſtood onely of the greater part, and not of all, as he had expounded it, of the loue of the whole hart towards God: fearing that he ſhould haue excluded the Saincts, &amp; ſo thereby haue loſt the offringes which he had vnder their names. But to returne to our new Mathematicians, &amp; ſee how their newe &amp; ſtrange Philoſophy is able to beare, that there are accidents without ſubſtance: theyr Mathematicall ſcience may alſo as well beare it, that one peece is as much as the whole in this matter. There were ſome reaſon in it, and if they ſaid, that he, receaueth as much of Ieſus Chriſt, ſpiritually, which receaueth but one peece of bread that is diſtributed, as he which receaueth &amp; eateth the whole loafe: becauſe the bodie of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt is not deliuered &amp; eate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by peece meale, as the bread which repreſenteth it. But this can in no wiſe agree, if this bread be taken for the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall &amp; materiall body of Ieſus Chriſt. For, he hath alwayes a true naturall mans bodie, although he be glorified &amp; diſpoiled of his whole mortal ſtate and condition.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>m</hi> If the Angels liue with pretie round cakes, they may call this breade their breade. But what blaſphemie is this, to call a round white cake the bread of Angels, and of the children of God, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it for Ieſus Chriſt him ſelfe, the true bread of life, of the Angelles, and of all the elect of God, and not of ſuch dogges as theſe are, to change the true bread of life into round cakes which they the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues haue charmed? And therefore there is more reaſon to call theſe rounde cakes, the breade of
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:19770:74"/>Aſſes, wolues, dogges and hogges, then the bread of the ſheepe of Ieſus Chriſt: who hearken after none other voice but the voice of their ſhepheard: and receaue none other foode, but that which he giueth them.</p>

                  <hi>a</hi> HEere is to be noted, that whippit Sir Hugh hath not ſhewed all his ſleights and tricks in his daunce, from the one ende of the Altar to the other, &amp; from the firſt beginning of his enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude &amp; antike, but with pawſes, or with half turnes &amp; reprinſes, vnto the midſt therof, continually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the right ſide of the Altar.

<pb n="141" facs="tcp:19770:75"/>turnes &amp; reprinſes: one whiles going to the midſt of the Table, and there ſtay a while, making both ſhort &amp; very long pawſes: &amp; after that returning to the left ſide, vntill he repaſſe againe vnto the right. Now, we are further to vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, that there is neuer a one tricke in the daunce, nor yet euer a mopping and mowing whatſoeuer, that hath not many iolly miſticall and ſpirituall ſenſes, which I will at this time ſuppreſſe, becauſe it would be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer long and toto fooliſh a thing to ſpeake of.</p>

                  <hi>b</hi> The name of Sacrifice, is here taken, for the bread &amp; wine which ſhould be conſecrated &amp; ſacrified, &amp; yet are not. This admonition is here giuen for the auoiding of ſuch inconueniences as might fal out about theſe matters, which we more at large handled in the Cautels. Whereupon we are to note, that that which is here done in this behalfe, after the Geneua faſhio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; others, is in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places done after the offertory, according to the Popiſh manner</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>c</hi> It was decreed by the Councell of Wormes,<note place="margin">Ex lib. Con.</note> That there ſhould be nothing elſe offered in the Maſſe, ſaue onely the bread, and cup, as hath bin by other Councelles heretofore ordained: but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo that the wine ſhould in no wiſe be offred with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out water, as in deede it is not tollerated to offer water wtthout wine, but both at once.<note place="margin">Berno, de offie. Miſſ. cap. <hi>11.</hi> Ex lib. Con.</note> And in the Triburme Councel which was after celebrated in the dayes of the Emperour Arnulph, in the yeare, 895. it is in the ſame decreed, ſet downe, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly ordained, That two parts ſhould be wine, &amp; the third water. Which ordinance is laid vpon A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:19770:76"/>the fift, of whome we haue ſpoken in his place, &amp; vpon the other ancient Fathers. Howbeit I know not how this ordinance can agree with the decree of the fourth Councell of Orleance, ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized about the time of Pelagius the firſt, in the dayes of king Childebert: by which decree it was ordained, that none ſhould preſume to offer anie thing in the oblations of the holy Cup, but that which was thought to be of the fruite of the vine: &amp; that, not to be mingled with water. I know not whether the fault be in the book, or in the ill ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of it. And after the reaſon is there eftſones re<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred. For, it is ſaid, That that is to be iudged ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, when any other thing is offered, then that which our ſauiour hath by his holy co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts ordained. I leaue the reconciling of this matter to thoſe to whom it more concerneth then vs.</p>

                     </gap>rine</note> which make mention of the mingling of the water with wine, alleadge for a reaſon of this ordinance, that the ſame is a ſignification of the coniunction and vnion of the people, ſignified by the waters in the Apocalypſe, with Ieſus Chriſt, ſignified by the wine. And therefore it is expreſly ſaid, that 2. parts muſt be wine, and the 3. water: becauſe the wine which ſignifieth the Maieſtie of Ieſus, is far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then the water, which ſignifieth but the maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie of the people. But who gaue them this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement, and who reuealed this ſecreat vnto them? what places and teſtimonies of the holie Scripture haue they, to teſtifie this? For, if it were ſo, it is wonder, that they would not ſounde one
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:19770:76"/>word thereof amongſt all the wordes which they mu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble vp, when they powre the wine and water into the Chalice: but make mention rather of an other miſterie, which S. Auguſtine hath touched: howbeit his mind was not of the mingling of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with the wine in the Chalice, but looked vnto the blood and water which guſhed out of Chriſt Ieſus ſide. Wherupon he ſaith,<note place="margin">Iohn. <hi>1.</hi> Auguſt.</note> That that ſide was the fountaine of the Sacraments of the Chriſtian Church, to wit of Baptiſme, &amp; of the Supper: by which, as firſt by Baptiſme the waſhing awaye of our ſinnes, and by the Supper, our redemption. By which Supper the ſacrifice &amp; ſheding of the blud of Ieſus Chriſt therein are ſignified vnto vs: with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the which, we could not be redeemed. Nowe there is farre greater reaſon in this miſticall expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of S. Auguſtine, which they here touch by the words that they pronounce, when they make this mixture, then in this application, and in the other miſterie which hertofore was propounded. For it is ſufficiently enough repreſented in Baptiſme, &amp; in the Supper, without making of another new &amp; ſtrange Sacrament after their own faſhio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded onely vpon allegories and imaginations of their owne heades. For, what greater vnion can they repreſent between Ieſus Chriſt &amp; the faithfull, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that which is repreſented by the whole action &amp; adminiſtration of the Supper, which is the trewe Sacrament of vnion? By which, the coniunction that is betweene the head and the members is ſo liuely expreſſed by the vnion of the graines, whereof the wine and breade are made: which
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:19770:77"/>by the water can not bee ſo well repreſented, being not made of ſo many graines as the wine is. And therefore they might verie well content them ſelues with Ieſus Chriſtes ſimple and pure ordinaunce.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>e</hi> We haue here a verie proper and pleaſaunt enterlude. For if the Maſſe be not ſo ſolemnized, as that there be three players in it, to wit, the Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con, Subdeacon, &amp; Sir Gurdegobreſſe, who play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the notableſt part, Sir Gurdebreaſſe muſt in this point play the drunken Prieſt, and both ſing and aunſwere him ſelfe. For, firſt of all, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth him ſelfe to bleſſe him ſelfe, and after, doth that which he commaundeth him ſelfe. But how euer it is with him, he muſt take his leaue to reade the wordes of the Goſpell: that is to ſay, ſo to deliuer it, as that no man vnderſtandeth one worde that is in it. For, ſuch Apoſtles and meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers hath the Popiſh Church, who are ſent out to announce the Goſpell in the Maſſe, without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring anie thing of that they ſay: which is not the office of a true and good meſſenger. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is not this a great mockery which the Popiſh Church vſeth, to haue the Deacon deſire to haue his lippes and hart purified, as the lippes of Iſaiah were with an hote burning cole, that he might be made morthy to ſet forth the holy Goſpell? Is not this euen to mock and ſcorne both God &amp; men?</p>

                  <hi>c</hi> A Creatour, is more proper and vſuall, then a maker: and the Greeke word is ſo ſet downe for that purpoſe. And therefore ſeeing it is ſo, that God is the creatour of all thinges, and conſeque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Gouernour and Guider of them, and vphol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth and mainteineth them, why runne the prieſts to creatures, and other what ſoeuer they are, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be to men, or women Saintes, but to him alone, if they take him for the creatour, &amp; father, and all the reſt, for creatures. For, to pray to any other then vnto God, is againſt this Article. For, prayer without faith, cannot be right. Now, none of vs all confeſſe in this Creede, which conteineth the very whole ſome and effect of Faith and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian religion, that we beliue in any other then in God the Father, the Sonne, &amp; the holy Ghoſt. No, we do not ſay that we beleue in the Church her ſelfe: But only that we do beleue the Church. For, there is a difference betwene that that we beleue of the Church, and that which we beleue of God the Father, of the Sonne, and of the holy Ghoſt, &amp; in them: in whom, we ſay we beleue: that is to ſay, that we put our whole truſt and confidence in them, but not in the Church. For, it, is compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of men: and as the Prophete ſayeth, curſed is that man, which putteth his truſt in man. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, we onely ſay, that as we put our truſt in the Father, the Sonne, and the holy Ghoſt: we beleue alſo that ther is a Church, that is to ſay, an holy aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblee, by reaſon of this affiaunce that it hath in the Father<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Sonne, &amp; the holy Ghoſt, by whom it is ſanctified, and ſtayeth it ſelfe vpon one God,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:19770:82"/>who is father vnto it, by the loue of his ſonne Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, through the ſanctification of the holy Ghoſt. Then is it not God, neither the Father, nor the Sonne, nor yet the holy Ghoſt, nor any parte or member of the Deitie, no not the Angels them ſelues: but are all creatures. And therefore, if it be not lawfull to beleue in them, neither is it law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to call vpon them in ſteed of God, and of our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt our Lord, and giue them the honour which apperteineth to God alone, if we will not gaine ſay the whole volume of the word of God, the Church it ſelfe, and the faith thereof: I meane not the Popiſh church, which is not plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with ſuch a faith, but the true auncient Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church.</p>

               <p>FRom the ſinging and rehearſing of the Creed, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto the Canon, there is almoſt no ſpeach had of the Oblation. This parte alſo of the Maſſe, is ſo named, which in old time was the beginning of the Maſſe of the Catechumeni. Now a man may in it, ſee, many goodly thinges, for the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vp of his faith, and beleuing of that which heretofore we haue treated of, touching the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringes of the faithfull in the auncient Church, &amp; the preſentation of them vnto the Lord, lifting vp on hie, and recommending vnto him, the thinges, which they offred. All this geare, is now at this preſent referred to the bread and wine, which are prepared in the ſacrifice, with prayers, that the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fring of them is for the ſaluation, of quicke and dead, of bodyes and ſou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>les, and not by the merite of Ieſus Chriſt alone, but alſo through the merite
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:19770:83"/>of men and women Saintes. As concerning the principall part of this point of the enterlude, after that this ſcraping Squibbe, hath gotten the mony into his maungy fiſtes, he then maketh his Sermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Howbeit we will here ceaſe to ſpeake any farther of this matter.<note place="margin">Dict. <hi>3.</hi> Ca. Omnis Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianus. Nico. de Plou. expo. <hi>3.</hi> part. Miſſ.</note> For it ſhall ſuffice that we ſpeake onely of the offringes, amongeſt which, there are ſome of them, which Chriſtians, in ſome feaſtes are bound, vnto, according to the ordinarie cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, as is conteined in the Decres: Becauſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth it is writen, <hi>Thou ſhalt not come before me em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pty fiſted.</hi> And againe, there are other Canons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongeſt the auncient Councels, which are not at this day very well obſerued. For, firſt, it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed in the Elibertine Councell, celebrated in Spaine about the time of the Nicene Councell,<note place="margin">Libr.

But at this day it is cleane contrary. For euery man bringeth giftes and offringes to the churches, and no man communicateth there, ſaue only the prieſt, which ſayeth the Maſſe, except it be ſome dayes in the yeare.<note place="margin">Libr. Con.</note> And in the Councell of Aquiſgraue (called Bawmorte) celebrated vnder king Pepin the ſon of Lewys: it was decreed, that no man ſhould of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer any thing which he had not receiued from the hand of the Lord, &amp; which he had not iuſtly got, and was acceptable in his ſight. For, it is writen, He that offreth to God of the ſpoile of the poore, is like vnto him that offred a child in the preſence of his Father. Who ſoeuer he be then, that will
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:19770:84"/>offer any thing vnto the Lord as be commeth him, let him firſt of all,<note place="margin">

Thus we ſee what is ſaid in theſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, of the offringes of the Church, which ſhould not be giuen to the profit of the prieſtes, if it were rightly obſerued. For, with what kindes of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringes are they moſt of all enriched, ſaue onely with the riches of the great theeues and extortio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners? And beſides, if they ſhould receaue no of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringes, but of thoſe which communicated at the Supper, they ſhould receiue none but vpon ſuch dayes as they communicated it to all the people. This ordinance, againe admoniſheth vs, that there was a communio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for all the people at the Supper, at ſuch time as this was made: and that they, who did not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate without they had ſome law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full let, were accompted is prophane and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then people.</p>

                  <hi>b</hi> This fragment, which is taken for the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fertory, is taken out of Leuiticus,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Leui.</hi> 21.</note> but not in ſuch ſorte as it is there ſet downe. Now, here in this, is a wonderfull skorning of God. For, firſt of all, the prieſt which ſayeth Maſſe, exhorteth the people to pray, ſaying, let vs pray: and after, he himſelfe prayeth neuer a whit. For, there is no mention of prayer in theſe wordes, but onely an aduertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which the Lord gaue, to the Leuitical prieſts onely, how they, ſhould vnderſtand to gouerne and behaue them ſelues in their office, &amp; not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Popiſh prieſtes. For, there is no mention made here of the ſacrifices of the Maſſe, neither of the bread, nor yet of the incenſe which therein are offred: But of the Leuiticall ſacrifices, of burnt offringes and loaues of bread, that were offred in them: not in the figure of the Popiſh prieſtes, and of their round wafer cakes, and ſacrifices, but in the figure of Ieſus Chriſt the hie Prieſt (who is the true bread that came downe from heauen) and of his ſacrifice,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.9. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6.</note> by which he offred and gaue him ſelfe for the life of the world. And therefore this ſacrifice, ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in no wiſe iumpe with the prieſts of the Romiſh church, without they will ſay that they are the Leuiticall ſucceſſion, and Iewes, ſtill looking for the comming of the hie prieſt Ieſus Chriſt. For, if they ſhould ſo do, they ſhould be no ſaints, but through ſuch blaſphemy, villanouſly
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:19770:86"/>trample vnder foote the name of the Lord.</p>

For, where Dauid pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth to giue thankes to God, for the ſauing health and deliuerance which he had beſtowed vpon him, and that through a banket of praiſe: this blaſphemour applieth it to his goblet, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he here ſo pleaſauntly playeth his parte, and wherby he renounceth the very true ſauing health &amp; deliuerance, which we haue receaued, through the ſacrifice and benefite of his death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>d</hi> Loe here the ſleights and trickes of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blet. Loe here, a pleaſaunt cup of ſaluation, &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent ſacrifice. It ſeemeth here that he meaneth to offer to drinke to God, when as he toſſeth vp his goblet in ſo hie a maner. But what is it that he here offreth? what is it that he would haue mount vp ſo hie? Is it wine? For by their doctrine it is not yet blood. I am a fraid to ſpeake of the bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphemies conteined in this prayer, for they are as many as their are wordes and ſyllables. To what purpoſe ſerueth Ieſus Chriſt any more, if the maſſe, and his ſacrifice haue this power and vertue both for quicke and dead, as is here ſet downe?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>e</hi> O thou helliſh blaſphemer, is this the honor which thou doſt to the holy Trinity, to offer thy goblet, in the ſteed of the blood of the very Sonne of God? and not onely in remembraunce of Ieſus Chriſt, which died for vs, but alſo of the men and women ſaints who neuer died for vs. And beſides if this be in remembrance, wherefore takeſt thou it then for the ſacrifice and oblation it ſelfe, which

He findeth fault alſo with one thing that is here committed in this vſage, which we follow at this preſent: that is, that after that this ſacrifice is done in the remembraunce of the death and reſurrection of Ieſus Chriſt, that it is not conuenient any other remembraunce ſhould be had in it, either of the natiuitie, or of any ſuch other like.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>f</hi> He maketh the goblet friske it here, all a pleaſure.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>g</hi> He taketh the ſawcer alſo in his hand, to make his round Robin alſo whip it about, ouer which, he vomiteth as many blaſphemies, as he doth ouer his goblet. And therefore all this is ſaid in hudder mudder, after the maner of Magicia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>iurers. After this he falleth a iuggling about his goblet, and iolly round Robin, beſides his encen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, according to the Romiſh office, which is ſtuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed with as many blaſphemies: &amp; cauſeth the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blet &amp; cake alſo to be ence<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſed at the table. This is it, which they make Leo the third, to be the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall authour of, and they attribute it alſo to the Councell of Roan.

               <p>
                  <hi>a</hi> HEre is now the ſecond, and ſolemneſt, hand waſhing in the Maſſe, but yet not the moſt delicate. And therefore Iohn ſweet lippes, licketh not his fingers. He is contented to waſh and make cleane his handes, as Pilate did, when he was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to condemne Ieſus Chriſt. For, ſeeing he will needes ſacrifice it, and that there can be no ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice without ſhedding of blood, and death, when any liue thing is ſacrificed, how farre is he behind Pilate (I pray you) who condemned Ieſus Chriſt to be hanged on the croſſe? He may then very well bragge, that he waſheth his polluted handes amongeſt innocentes, or in innocencie, as it is in the Pſalme, which this blaſphemour abuſeth here ſo villanouſly. But is there either rime or reaſon here in this? I will ſpeake no more of the blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies which are in theſe prayers, either becauſe they are altogether contrary to the true calling on the name of God, and the merite of Ieſus Chriſt, or elſe becauſe they are ill fauouredly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, and the holy word of God, by them, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaned and diſhonored.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>b</hi> Here are croſſes plentie. The prieſtes are very well contented to skirmiſh with them, and
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:19770:88"/>kiſſe them as long as you will: but to beare the croſſe of Ieſus Chriſt for his wordes ſake, backe with that legge. They cannot skill of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>c</hi> Who is that inuiſible ſacrificer and keeper, that he calleth vpon, for the ſanctifying of ſo exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable a ſacrifice? If it be he for whome it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, and in whoſe name it is offred, ſurely it cannot be the holy Ghoſt,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.6.</note> nor yet Ieſus the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of holy ones, but the vncleane ſpirite who gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth and ruleth the enemies of Ieſus.<note place="margin">Berno of the office of the Maſſe Ca. <hi>12.</hi>
                  </note> Berno te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifieth that this prayer is ſaid after the vſe of the Gaules and French.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>d</hi> Euery man may here ſee the pitches and turnes, and legier de maines that are vſed and played, to all ententes &amp; purpoſes. And amongeſt all the reſt it is ordeined that maiſter Iohn muſt turne him ſelfe to the people, and recommend him to their prayers, promiſing them alſo to lend them his. Howbeit the people vnderſtand not a word of that he ſayeth. Wherefore he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth this his recommendation without haply it ſerue him for the ſtopping of a gappe, for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter garniſhing and furniſhing of the play. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, we haue to note, that if he haue but one to make aunſwere, he ſhould ſay, brother, pray, and not brethren, pray ye.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>e</hi> Here, he maketh all theſe his companions, that are at Maſſe with him, ſaying, that the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice which he offreth, is aſwell theirs, as his. And therefore if he renounce Ieſus Chriſt in of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fring it, they all likewiſe renounce him, which are at Maſſe with him. It ſhould ſeeme, that this
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:19770:89"/>was taken from the maner and vſe of the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Church, wherein the Miniſters of the word of God, deſiered the Church to pray for them, and wherein alſo, they which offred their goods, aſwell for the ſuſtentation of the poore, as for the maintenaunce of the diuine ſeruice, called vpon God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>f</hi> He againe exhorteth to prayer, and after, prayeth him ſelfe in ſecret, when he hath a litle pitcht and turned. And therefore this prayer is called,<note place="margin">Nico. de Plou. expo. <hi>3.</hi> part. Miſſ.</note> Secret. And becauſe he ſometimes ſayeth moe then one of them, as he doeth of the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectes, it is leaft to my young Maiſters choiſe that doth the office: who hath a rule, to ſay alwayes as many Secrettes, as he ſhall ſay other collectes. Now, I could neuer yet finde out the Authours, that put to all theſe fragmentes which were put in, ſithence the Offertorie, without, as I take it, they be the Authours of the Secrettes, to whom they attribute the Collectes, becauſe they are ſuch prayers as alter and chaunge, according to the diuerſitie of the Maſſes. I know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther theſe Secrettes, were put into the Maſſe, in ſteed of prayers which are ſecretly made by eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one in particular in the auncient Church, after the deliuerie of the worde of God, and the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blicke prayers, which the Miniſter ſayeth in the name of the whole Church,<note place="margin">Alama. de of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fic. Miſſ. Ca. <hi>3.</hi> Cypria. de Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minica oratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne. Serm. <hi>6.</hi> Matth. <hi>6.</hi>
                  </note> yea or no. Alamarius meaning to re<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der a reaſon hereof, alleageth that, which S. Cyprian wrote, of the modeſty, counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and humilitie which are to be vſed &amp; ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued in prayer, finding fault with the diſorders
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:19770:89"/>that are committed therein. And amongeſt all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pointes he teacheth, that there is no need to vſe much babling: which thing our Sauiour Chriſt him ſelfe expreſlie hath touched. And beſides that it is not needefull forcibly to crie out therein, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that we are to deale with God, who both ſeeth and knoweth our hartes. Howbeit Cyprian his meaninge is not, that the common prayers, which are ſaide in the Church in the name of the whole Congregation, ſhould ſo baſely be mum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled vp, as that no man might bee able to heare them. For he ſpeaketh not onely of ſuch prayers, but generallie of all. For, it is one thing to praye particularly and a part, and another thing, to pray in common, as the miniſters of the Church doe, who are, as it were, the mouth of the whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Again why apply they not likewiſe this vnto their roaring and yelling, wherewith they make a farre greater noiſe in their Churches, then euer did the Prieſtes of Ball, as if their God were deafe, a ſleepe, or elſe dronke in ſome Tauerne? Wherfore ſay they not this in ſuch ſort, as they ſay the ſecretes and Canon?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>g</hi> There are ſome of their ſecretes in the Maſſe which containe horible blaſphhemies. As for this that is here ſet downe is not amiſſe, nor yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to the true doctrine of the Supper. They make it not here ſtrange to vſe this worde, Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth, declaring that the Supper repreſenteth the peace and vnion which wee haue in Ieſus Chriſt: which cannot be vnderſtood of their Maſſe, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto they applye it. For, what ſignification can
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:19770:90"/>there be of peace and vnion in the Prieſts particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Supper, and in the breade and wine which he offereth? This may be ſaid of the Supper, hauing regard to the ſacrifice of thankeſgiuing, which is there offred, giuing thankes vnto Ieſus Chriſt by the communicating thereof with a common ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corde and conſent.</p>

                  <hi>a</hi> HEre, M. hethethee hothethee, ſtandeth like a man in a great amaze.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>b</hi> Here in this point is ſome great matter: for, he ſaith the ſecrete very ſoftly, for feare he ſhould be heard, and ſoone after crieth out aloude, to no purpoſe in the world, <hi>for euer and euer:</hi> To th'end
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:19770:91"/>that the people, &amp; they which help him at Maſſe, might anſwer, <hi>Amen.</hi> without ether hearing or yet vnderſtanding what it was that he ſaid, neither yet whereunto he referreth this his <hi>Per omnia.</hi> For this word <hi>Amen,</hi> is an Hebrewe word, by which, they that ſpeake it, declare their conſent to that which is ſaid, and teſtifie that they take it to be true, and wiſh it to be ſo. But how can he that ſo anſwereth anſwere in trueth, without he do it ſcoffingly and merily, when as he vnderſtandeth not that, which he affirmeth and teſtifieth? For it is as if a manne ſhould ſet his hand and ſeale vnto an obligation, or letter, hauing neuer read it, nor yet knowinge what is within it. And therefore the holy Apoſtle ſaith, How ſhall he ſay Amen to thy prayer, who neither knoweth what thou ſayeſt, nor yet vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth thee one whit?<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.</note> And if this be to be done in the publique prayers of the Church, it is much more requiſite in the adminiſtration of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. For, ſith they are as it were a confirmation of the contract and couenaunt which the Lorde hath made with vs: what proteſtation, are we a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, for our partes, to make, if we vnderſtand not the contents and articles of the couenant, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the Sacramentes are as it were the ſeales? It is alſo much like, as if men ſhould ſeale to a couena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and vnderſtood not what it is, &amp; as if they ſhould beare witnes vnto it, &amp; yet knew not the contents thereof. And therfore the Sacramental words of all Sacramentes, are ſo to be vttered, as that they to whom they appertaine, might, as well as their capacitie were able to beare it, vnderſtand them.</p>
               <pb n="173" facs="tcp:19770:91"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>c</hi> Here he ſaluteth the people with his tayle towardes them, without tourning him ſelfe about vnto them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>d</hi> Wee haue alreadie elſewhere declared to what end this is ſaid, and from whence it was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and how the contrarie is done in the Maſſe of this exhortation. And therefore the Doctors them ſelues of the Popiſh Church do teſtifie, that none can haue part of this Sacrament, without he lift vp his hart on high, and that manie of them which ſay, they lifte them vp on high, doe manie times ſhamefully lye.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>e</hi> Although all that goeth before, ſerueth for a preface, they eſpecially call all that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth it, by the ſame name, vnto the <hi>Sanctus.</hi> We haue ſomewhat at large ſpoken in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the diuerſitie of Prefaces, which alſo haue their ſeuerall tunes, accordinge to the dayes and feaſts, for which they are properly appointed. The Canons which we haue ſpoken of, that forbid no Collectes, prayers, prefaces, proſes, nor anie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Apocriphaes, noranie thing elſe that is not approued lawfull, to be vſed, haue yet rehearſed them in diuerſe and ſundrie Councels, as namely, in the ſecond Laodicean Councell, &amp; in the Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine. And therefore it was many times ordained, that there ſhould be but one fourme of the Diuine office: in one ſelfe ſame Prouince and Countrey: and eſpecially in the Gerundenſe, firſt Bracarien,<note place="margin">Ex lib. Con</note> fourth and eleuenth Tolentane, Councelles. For which cauſe, they had their diuerſe and ſundrie v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages giuen them, according to the diuerſity of the
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:19770:92" rendition="simple:additions"/>Biſhoprickes and Dioceſſes. The forme &amp; maner of the Preface which is here ſet down, is ordained to be ſaid euerie day from Chriſtmaſſe night vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Epiphanie. It ſerueth alſo for Candlemaſſe and this Corpus Chriſti day. The reſt of the feaſts, haue theirs alſo, by them ſelues. Furthermore I finde no great hurt in that, that is herein contay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, if it were applied as it ſhould be, that is, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the forme of the auncient Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>f</hi> This aduertiſement that is here giuen is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that hitherto M.

And in the end of his preface he putteth them againe together.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>g</hi> Ouer and beſides that which hath bene al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie ſaid of the ordinance of Pope Sixtus co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Sanctus, there is yet a Canon in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Vaſenſe Councell, which commaundeth it to be ſaid in all Maſſes, of what qualitie or condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſoeuer they be. It is a notable thing to ſee fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce this geare it fetcht. For, there is nothing, of it ſelfe, but is to the praiſe and glorie of God. But being applied to this Idoll of the Maſſe, wherfore ſerueth it, but onely for blaſphemie? For, the Lord knoweth what goodly Angelles, and Seraphims, we haue of theſe blaſphemers, to ſing praiſe vnto him. They may very wel cal him holy, holy, as ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as they luſt, when they ſo horriblie blaſpheme him. And they may verie wel alſo take vnto them, the name of Seraphims, which ſignifie as much, as burning and ſlaming, but not with loue to God
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:19770:92"/>and their neighboures, as men enlightened with the light of God, as the Angelles are: but burning and flaming with rage and furie, to perſecute and burne the children of God, which woulde praiſe him, as the Angelles doe: which they, quite and cleane take both from him, and from our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt alſo, tranſporting the ſame vnto an Idoll of paaſt, &amp; to that Romiſh Antichriſt, whom they call <hi>Sanctiſsime Pater,</hi> that is to ſay, moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Father, in the Superlatiue degree, compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending all in one word, which the Angels made three of.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>h</hi> They entermeddle manie words of ſtrange languages in their Maſſe (beſides their barbarous Latin) which they chieflie take from the Hebrues, and ſome from the Greekes: counterfaiting the Magicians, and heathen, and Marke the heretike, who were wont to intermeddle many barbarous, ſtrange, and hard wordes to pronounce, in their charmes and diuine offices, that they might ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by make the people, the more amazed,<note place="margin">Arno. contra Gent.

               <p>
                  <hi>c</hi> Our yong Maiſters, make manie ſtout &amp; ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g reaſons, about the expoſition of theſe 3. wordes, and all becauſe forſooth, mention is made in the plurall number, of gifts, preſents, and Sacrifices, as if there were moe of them then one. Which thing they will in no wiſe confeſſe. For, they ſay that Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt is there offered, which is but one onelie gifte and Sacrifice. Howbeit this difficultie was not in the Church, in which ſuch &amp; the like words were referred to the giftes and preſents which the faithfull offred in the Church, which were breade and wine, wherewith the Supper was celebrated. And all theſe gifts &amp; preſents, were called Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:19770:95"/>ſome, becauſe they were offred to God, for the releeuing of the poore me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers of Ieſus Chriſt,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.</note> in that ſenſe which the Apoſtle calleth the almes and releefe of the poore, Sacrifices: ſaying, that with ſuch Sacrifices and offrings God is wel plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: and ſome others againe, to wit, thoſe which wer take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be vſed about the Supper, were called alſo by that name, becauſe that the Supper is cele brated with thankeſgiuing, which the ſame Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle likewiſe calleth the ſacrifices of tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>keſgiuing, as all other ſorts of prayers are.<note place="margin">

Surely this muſt needs be a very goodly Sacrifice, &amp; wel worthy ſo high a Maieſtie: and a verie proper chaunge, to change Ieſus Chriſt into a ſinging cake and a litle wine, to make a Sacrifice of him. For, they are not here as yet tranſubſtantiated. Moreouer, they ſay that theſe croſſes and commemorations of giftes and preſents do ſignifie amongeſt the reſt,<note place="margin">Nicol. de Plo. de expoſ. Miſſ.</note> Iudas his treaſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>d</hi> They expound this worde <hi>illibata</hi> for <hi>incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptibile,</hi> although in verie deed, it ſignifieth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, a thing which was neuer diſme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bred nor ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted of, but an whole &amp; ſou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d thing. Now, they are againe verie much deceaued in the expoſition of this word, becauſe that oftentimes theſe iollie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible giftes, preſentes, and Sacrifices, doe greatly corrupt and rot, as we haue vnderſtood by the Cautelles of the Maſſe, heretofore recited. Whereupon,<note place="margin">Chap. <hi>3.</hi> li. Con.</note> an ordinance alſo was made in the
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:19770:95"/>third Councel of Arles (celebrated about the time of Pope Leo) againſt thoſe which looked not well vnto them, but ſuffred them to be loſt, or be eaten with miſe, or ſome other vermine: And therefore ſurely theſe could not be called <hi>illibata,</hi> that is to ſay, whole and ſound.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>e</hi> It was ordained in the 2. Vaſenſe Councel,<note place="margin">De expo.

                  <hi>a</hi> This commemoration is in ſtead of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendations that were wont to be vſed in the auncient Church, in that forme which hath elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where bin ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of as touching the publike pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers therof: howbeit it is an horrible thing to ſe the blaſphemies that are herein. Our young Maiſters rendring a reaſon,<note place="margin">Nicol. de Plo. de expoſ. Miſſ</note> why there is a commemoratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, made rather for the quicke, then for the dead, in this Canon ſay, That it is becauſe that the quicke are in farre greater daunger then the dead, for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the dead are greatly tormented in Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie, yet that they are without the danger of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nation, &amp; ſo are not the liuing. Now, if it be ſo, I greatly wonder why they haue not put in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration of theſe miſerable deade ſoules, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the commemoration of the Sainctes, which
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:19770:96"/>commeth after it. For, the Sainctes which are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie in glorie, haue a more pleaſaunt wayting, then theſe poore ſoules that lye broiling in Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie. Againe, if the Maſſe doe them no good for whom it is ſayed, vntill it be ended, or at the leaſt vntill the Sacrifice of it be offred: then,<note place="margin">Nicol. de Plo. de expoſ. Miſſ</note> theſe good ſoules loſe nothing by it, although they be made to waite ſomewhat the longer. Here is alſo to be noted, That theſe yong Maiſters commonly ſay their mementoes, as though they were a ſlepe and in a ſlomber, like vnto dormiſe. For which cauſe our Maiſters finde great fault <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>th them, as well, for that it commeth oftentimes to paſſe, that they which are at the Maſſe go away thence, being greeued to ſee them ſleepe, and tary ſo long in their buſineſſe, becauſe it is much better for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to diſpatch them ſelues of that which they cary in memorie, for the auoiding of the wandringe of their mindes this way and that, as oftentimes it falleth out.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>b</hi> This naming of women ſeruantes doth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie times giue occaſion of offence to manie of my young Maiſters, becauſe it putteth them in minde of their women ſeruantes that are at home in their houſes. Which thing is ſufficient enough to trouble their mindes, both to make them for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get their minding of conſecration and alſo make all thoſe become idolaters that are preſent with them at Maſſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>e</hi> This N. doth againe admoyiſh them of their names, which they are eſpecially to recommend.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>d</hi> This maner of ſpeeche declareth, that not
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:19770:97"/>onely the Prieſt which ſayeth the Maſſe offereth the Sacrifice which there is made, but alſo as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as are there with him. Wherefore then attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth he the workma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſhip to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that are with him as well as to him ſelfe? And therefore ſeing it is ſo, they which are at maſſe with him do aſmuch blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme the benefit of the death &amp; paſſion, &amp; of the Sacrificing of Ieſus co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted in the ſame, as they which ſay it. Nowe a man may eaſilie iudge, by that which followeth, whether there be any blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemie in it yea or no. For, it is namelye ſayed, that this Sacrifice is offered, for the ſaluation and redemption of the ſoules of all thoſe, which are preſent at it, and alſo of all theires: which can no wayes agree, but with the onelie Sacrifice which Ieſus made vpon the croſſe. Wherefore I greatlie maruell that the earth openeth not, and ſwalloweth vp theſe blaſphemoures, ſo often as this horrible blaſphemie proceedeth out of their mouths. VVe haue ſhewed in what ſenſe this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſpeaking was in vſe, to wit, For whome we offer thee, or, they which offer thee, when wee ſpake of the cuſtome that was ſometimes in the Church, in thoſe dayes when the Supper was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated, to all, and that they which there com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated, offred the bread that was there diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted, for the making of the Supper: but not to make ſuch a Sacrifice of it, as is here deſcribed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>e</hi> Wee haue alreadie handled and treated in what ſenſe the Supper might be called a Sacrifice of thankeſgiuing. Howbeit, they are not conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to make here of their Maſſe, ſuch a Sacrifice of
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:19770:97"/>thankeſgeuing as the Supper is, which alſo it can not be, ſeeing it is not in deede the Supper: But which is more, they make of it a propiciatory ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, that is to ſay for the remiſſion of ſinnes, in ſteed of geuing thankes with it, of that remiſſion and grace, obteined through the ſacrifice of the death of Ieſus, as is made in the true Supper of his, calling theſe iolly ſacrifices of theirs, their vowes, to wit, that which they haue promiſed and vowed to God: as if all what ſoeuer, both they them ſelues, and all Chriſtians beſides, are by their Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſme bound vnto, were compriſed within this ſacrifice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>f</hi> This importeth, that this ſacrifice ſtretcheth it ſelfe no further for them that are liuing, but for ſpirituall benefites, and for their ſaluation. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore then do they it for earthly benefites, and for brute beaſtes, and ſuch other like?</p>

                  <hi>a</hi> We haue heretofore, ſufficiently ſpoken of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>memoration of the Saints. This is the firſt of this Canon,<note place="margin">Dur. Rar. lib. <hi>4.</hi> Ru. de <hi>3.</hi> part. ca. Nic. de expo. Miſſ. <hi>4.</hi> part. Clithou. in Elucid.</note> which Nicholas de Ploue, attributeth not vnto Syrice as the reſt do, but vnto Linus the firſt. Howbeit, who ſoeuer is authour thereof, it altereth and chaungeth in ſundrie ſolemne and feſtiuall daies, by reaſon of diuerſe additio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s which are put to it. We haue ſpoken alſo of that which Gregorie the third added for the Saintes dayes. And here is alſo to be noted, that ech monke, frier and prieſt thruſteth in their patrones as pleaſeth them. It is eaſely to be iudged, that this peece was patched, too long, after the death of Ieſus Chriſt, becauſe that the names of Saintes are in it, which were long time after: yea and ſuch ſaintes to, as are not very well knowen: howbeit there is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie, but that we muſt needes beleue thoſe men which haue enrolled them. At the leaſt, there is one Gryſogone, who, if I be not deceiued, is put in for Chryſogone. But I know not whence they had him. Here are two pointes, principally to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, in this maner of commemoration. The firſt is, that they ioyne the commemoration of the Saints
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:19770:101"/>with the commemoratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Ieſus Chriſt, as if they were all alike and fellowes, and, as though the Supper had bene ordeined aſwell for it, as for that of Ieſus Chriſtes. The other is, the praying that is made to them in it, and not to Ieſus Chriſt alone. And what ſoeuer we ſpeake here of this comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moration, may alſo ſerue for all the reſt that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after enſue.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>b</hi> Here is ſomewhat a ſtrange kind of ſpeach, whereas they ſay of the virgine Mary, <hi>genetricis Dei, &amp; Domini noſtri Ieſu Chriſti,</hi> which is aſmuch as if we ſhould ſay, a begetter, or which hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten God, &amp; our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. I know not whether they meane to counterfet the poete in v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing for <hi>Mater,</hi> which ſignifieth mother, by this word, <hi>Genitrix,</hi> which the Latines neuer vſe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it be in verſifying and in poeſie: or elſe whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they thinke it to be more elegant, becauſe it is not ſo common, but leſſe vſed. Wherein, they ſauour much of their countrey Schoolemaiſters, who furniſh their compoſitions with all the moſt eloquent wordes they can poſſibly get, be they poeticall or otherwiſe, ſo that they be ſtraunge, &amp; rare in vſe. For therin co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſteth al their whole ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancie. Howbeit the maner of ſpeach which they in the olde time vſed, is nothing like to this. For they haue, according to the meaning of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, rightly ſaied that, which we ſo often times haue heard in the Creede, that the Father being verie God, hath begotten the Sonne, who is alſo very God of very God: but when we ſpeake of the virgine Mary, we ſay that Ieſus was borne of
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:19770:102"/>her, and not begotten of her. But we will ouer ſlippe this, as a thing that may be more fitly han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled. Neuertheleſſe there is yet an other point herein to be handled, and that is this, that when Saint Paule vſeth this maner of ſpeach, &amp; ſayeth, God, and our Lord Ieſus Chriſt: the name of God is referred commonly to the Father, and the name of our Lord, to Ieſus Chriſt. For, although Ieſus Chriſt the very Sonne of God, is very God with the Father, and the Father alſo, Lord, aſwell as the Sonne: yet for all that, there is a difference in ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the vnitie of God, and of the diſtinction of the three perſonnes in Trinitie. And therefore according to the maner of Saint Paule his ſpeach, and the vnderſtanding of his wordes, we ſhould here vnderſtand, that the virgine Marie, ſhould not be the mother of Ieſus Chriſt alone, but alſo of the Father, and that ſhe had begotten, both the Father and the Sonne. But if they would ſay, that this is here ſet downe to meete with the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie of the Neſtorians, thereby to declare, that Ieſus Chriſt is not man alone: or that there are in him two perſonnes, as he is in one and the ſelfe ſame perſon, verie God and verie man: it might be a great deale more properly ſpoken in other wordes, and neuer abuſe the wordes of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle.</p>

                  <hi>a</hi> This is one of thoſe prayers which is againe attributed to Leo and Gregory. They which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide the Canon but into fiue partes, begin here the ſecond conteining the conſecration of the ſacrifice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>b</hi> I will not here enter into the expoſition of the epithetes and titles which they here giue vnto their oblation. And therefore they which haue a minde to vnderſtand them, may learne them at their handes which haue treated of that matter. It is enough for vs that we aduertiſe here the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, to call to minde that which we haue already admoniſhed them of, elſe where, as concerning the bread and wine in the Supper, which were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the offrings of the faithful: &amp; remember likewiſe that which we haue already ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dled ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what at large of the tranſubſtantiatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients, and in what ſenſe they vnderſtood how the bread and wine were made the body &amp; blood of our Lord Ieſus in the Supper, and chaunged &amp; turned into them. For we haue here, the maner &amp; teſtimonie of all theſe thinges. For, this oblation, which is here ſpoken of, according as they in the
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:19770:104"/>olde time vſed it (in that ſenſe that it hath alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy bene interpreted) was taken from the giftes and preſents which we haue ſo often made men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of. And therfore the Church made this prayer vnto God, not meaning that the ſubſtance of the bread and wine were changed into the ſubſtance of the body and blood of Ieſus Chriſt, according to the doctrine of Popiſh tranſubſtantiation: but that they were dedicated and conſecrated vnto this holy Sacrament, truely to repreſent this bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and blood, and the right communicating of them, in ſuch ſenſe as we haue already handled them, when as we ſpake of the nature of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration, &amp; in what ſignification the ſame ought to be taken. For, if theſe wordes be otherwiſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, they are taken contrary to the meaning of the holy Scriptures and the auncient Church: as hath very largely and manifeſtly bene ſhewed by the teſtimony of the auncient Church doctors, alleaged for that purpoſe, by occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the office of the Feaſt of Corpus Chriſti day: who haue vſed the like wordes, in the very ſelfe ſame ſenſe that we expound theſe. Howbeit, theſe our Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtes, haue playd their partes herein, as they haue done in all other ſuch like thinges, applying this to their tranſubſtantiation, as they haue applied the teſtimonies of the auncient doctours: cleane contrary to the meaning both of the doctours, &amp; alſo of the auncient Church. And therefore this prayer may very well be thus taken, as a requeſt which the Church requireth, that the bread and wine might be ſo dedicated and conſecrated to
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:19770:104"/>this holy Sacrament, as that in communicating thereof, it might alſo be a true partaking of the body and blood of Ieſus Chriſt, and of their ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice: as in very deed they are figured by the bread and wine, and as the bread and wine, by a ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall and ſpirituall preſence and vnion do lay them open before vs. And ſurely there is no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why we ſhould take it in the ſame ſenſe that the Romaniſtes take it, for, in it, is conteined a moſt intollerable blaſphemy. For, what a kind of ſpeach is this, to craue at the handes of God, to haue the ſubſtaunce of bread and wine chaunged into the ſubſtaunce of the body and blood of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt? For, if that ſhould be ſo, it would there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon follow, that that which before was bread, is now become the body of Chriſt, which in very deed it was not. And ſo, the body of Chriſt ſhal be a new body, and not that body which is in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For, if it be the ſame body which is in heauen, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can not the bread be turned into it, and be made that body that before it was. For, what ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of the ſubſtance of bread, ſeeing it hath no more the ſubſtance of bread. And therfore it muſt either vtterly become nothing, or elſe become ſuch a thing as it neuer was before. For, this bread muſt either be conuerted into the body of Ieſus Chriſt, or elſe this body muſt needes be a new bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by of Ieſus Chriſt: or, if it be the ſame that is in heauen, it muſt needes be that the bread muſt be onely ioined vnto it, or elſe this body muſt needes grow into the ſame ſubſtaunce that the bread is of, which is ioined vnto it. The Queſtionarie and
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:19770:105"/>Sophiſticall doctors, ſeeing that theſe abſurdities and an infinite number of other ſuch like, woulde follow vpon this doctrine, haue, through diuerſe gloſes &amp; expoſitions, wonderfully tormented the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues, to make an open waye to eſcape withall, which we haue ſufficiently ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of in our booke of the miniſtery &amp; Sacraments.

                  <hi>b</hi> Here we ſee the wordes of the conſecrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Now, they that wil conferre theſe words, with the wordes of the Euangeliſtes and of S.

For, as we haue heretofore ſayd in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places, they no whit followe either the Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſtes or yet the Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>c</hi> Alamarius meaning to ſhew that the maſſe was founded vpon that which is here recited,<note place="margin">Alama. de off. Miſſ. Ca. <hi>14.</hi>
                  </note> that our Lord Ieſus did, ſayeth for the firſt point, That the Prieſt doth that which Ieſus did whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he tooke the bread, when as he beginneth to take it into his handes, after the offertory, and the Secrettes: and that he here taketh it: and giueth thankes as he did, whenas he ſayeth the preface, and bleſſeth it here. Wherein he putteth a difference betwene bleſſing, and thankesgiuing, notwithſtanding that the Euangeliſts haue put in the one for the other, and not both of them at once, &amp; ſo content them ſelues with the one, and leaue out the other, ſo long as one of them is in. Howbeit the Prieſtes make them goe arme in arme togither, as if there were ſome great difference betwene them, and ſuch a difference in deede as it pleaſeth them to ſet downe of them. Afterward he ſayeth, that the Prieſt breaketh the bread as he did, whenas he breaketh the hoſte. And beſides that he diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth it, and maketh a communion thereof, as Ieſus Chriſt did. But to whome diſtributeth he it? For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:19770:106"/>to none but to him ſelfe. Wherefore then ſayeth he here, Eate ye all of this. Either Alamari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us was diſpoſed to be mery when he ſayd this: or els it muſt needes be, that at thoſe dayes when he wrote theſe things, there was a publike communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for all the people in the maſſe. Nowe he was Archbiſhop of Trieues, in the dayes of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour Lewys the godly, vnto whome he dedicated his booke. At the leaſt, he neuer found that euer Ieſus Chriſt lifted vp either the bread or Chalice, to cauſe them to be worſhipped: neither yet any foundation of the maner how he adminiſtred the ſupper, whereby he is able to ſhew, wherein, he ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther repreſenteth or yet followeth Ieſus Chriſt in this point.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>d</hi> Firſt of all, the prieſt here worſhippeth the God which he him ſelfe hath made: and when he hath ſo done, he lifteth it vp ouer his head with his arſe towards them, that others might alſo ſee it, &amp; likewiſe worſhip it. And al this while there is ſuch tolling and tingling of Belles, ſuch playing of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganes, &amp; ſuch delicate muſicke, eſpecially if it be vpon any ſolemne feſtiuall day, as was vſed in the worſhipping of Nebuchadnezer his idoll. There is alſo great ſtore of lights. And amongeſt the reſt, there are ſome which haue ſtaffe torches lighted in one of their handes, and with the other they beare vp the chaſuble of that worſhipful Sir Gur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>degobreas, as if they meant to ſet him an ende, as Apothecaries vſe to deale with thoſe vnto whom they miniſter their cliſters. And all this while it is a wonder to ſee what bald countenaunces &amp; vile
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:19770:107"/>faces euery of them maketh in worſhipping of this iolly newe printed paaſty God, as white and round, as the ſlyfe of a turneup roote. Berno ſaith, that the Romaniſtes haue ordeined, that no maſſe ſhall be celebrated without both tapers and waxe candles lighted. And although they haue many waxe candles &amp; lampes at this their helliſh ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, continually burning, yet muſt there needes be the greateſt &amp; moſt palpable darkenes amongſt them that poſſibly can be, whenas they worſhip a round cake &amp; peece of paaſte, in ſteede of Ieſus Chriſt the very ſonne of God, &amp; the very true Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour and Redeemer of all mankind. And for ſo much as that this round cake is not God vntil ſuch time as the Sacramental wordes be fully &amp; wholy pronounced ouer it, our venerable maiſters doe of ſet purpoſe admoniſh the gentle maiſter God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, to be very carefull, ſo to deale with this round Robin of the boxe, as that none of the people ſee it, before ſuch time as it be conſecrated &amp; turned into God by reaſon of the danger that ſome ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple &amp; ignorant folke might fall into, in worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping it before it were God, &amp; thereby become ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Idolaters. Nowe, it is meete here to be noted, that in this conſecration, are conteined, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, natiuitie, apparition and comming of this newe Chriſt: vnto whome they chaunt vp his <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedictus,</hi> before he be conceiued or yet borne.

               <p>
                  <hi>b</hi> When our young Maiſter ſpeaketh of the paſſion, he muſt hold his hands &amp; armes a croſſe: and when he ſpeaketh of the reſurrection, he muſt withdraw them: But when he ſpeaketh of the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion, then his worſhipfulneſſe muſt lifte them vp aboue his ſhoulders. Is not this here I beſeech you, a iollie merie Redeemer, and pleaſant Ieſus Chriſt? Who is it that will not be afeard to heare theſe ſcoffes and blaſphemies? Wherefore I will ſurceaſſe to ſpeake any more of theſe their miſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call expoſitions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>c</hi> Here are notable iollie ſeruants of God, &amp; a wonderfull holy people, who vtterly deny their Sauiour that redeemed them. For, what meaneth this offring of a round peece of paſt, vnto the moſt excellent Maieſtie of God, which they here call, a pure, holie, and immaculate hoſt, and the bread of life, &amp;c? Is not here (I pray you) a goodly excha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge to haue Ieſus Chriſt the verie true bread of life, to be turned into a round cake, &amp; corruptible peece of bread?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>d</hi> They which deuided this Canon into fiue partes onely, make the thirde part there of in this place, which is a prayer, that containeth another moſt horrible blaſphemie. For here, this curſed
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:19770:110"/>blaſphemer praieth for the Sonne of God, to haue the Father accept of him: that is to ſay, his Sonne Ieſus, whome he, according to his minde, offreth vnto him, euen as the auncient Patriarches, that are here named, did their corruptible thinges, which they offred vnto the Lorde. For, although he offreth in verie deede, nothing elſe but bread and wine, yet forſooth, his intent is to offer the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie bodie and blood of Ieſus Chriſt, the verie true Sonne of God. Now, if the Sacrifice which he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred, had not bene more acceptable vnto the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then thoſe Sacrifices which the auncient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers offered, it had not bene needefull for him to haue come to perfourme that, which they by no meanes were able to perfourme, by theſe Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. And therefore ſeing he is come, and hath per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed it, what meaneth here this blaſphemour? For, if he offer vp that ſacrifice which Ieſus Chriſt offred, what needeth he pray for the ſame, &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come an aduocate vnto God the Father for him, that he might be acceptable vnto his maieſty. And beſides, whie maketh he him a companion with the materiall Sacrifices of the ancient Patriarkes, of whom he here ſpeaketh? Moreouer, if there be nothing elſe but bread &amp; wine which he offreth, what neede wee anie ſuch Sacrifice to be ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the ſound and perfect Sacrifice of Ieſus Chriſt?</p>

This poore Sir Iohn had here great need to be comforted: for he is left here poſt alone, and hath manie thinges to do. For, after he hath, all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, played the partes of Iudas, the Iewes, Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, and the hangman,<note place="margin">Alam. de offic. Miſſ. Cap. <hi>25.</hi> Berno de offic. Miſſ. Cap. <hi>17.</hi> Nicol. de Plo. de expoſ. Miſſ</note> and crucified and Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Ieſus Chriſt: he muſt here yet once more play the part of the Iewes, who knocked vppon their breaſtes, after that Ieſus was dead, &amp; of the thiefe that hong by him. Our yong Maiſters ſay, that this
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:19770:119"/>was an honeſt theefe, but they may paraduenture be deceaued. And beſides this he muſt alſo play the Centurions parte, who ſaide, Truely this was the verie Sonne of God. And therfore, he knocked vpon his breaſt, lifted vp his voice, and confeſſed him ſelfe to be as great a ſinner as any of the reſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>b</hi> This is the laſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>memoration of the ſaints that is in all the Canon. And here it might verie well be diſputed, wherefore the men and women Sainctes that are here named, are rather put in in this place, then a great manie of others that are farre more worthie. Howbeit we wil leaue the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciding hereof vnto our yong Maiſters.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>c</hi> They haue great reaſon, that no Amen, be here aunſwered, for the ratifying of that, that hath beene alreadie ſayed. For, what hope ought theſe Apoſtles haue to come into the company of the Saincts that are with God, who ſo villanouſly here renounce the verie Sonne of God, by whom and through whome the Sainctes are entred into that heauenly glorie, and who take a cleane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary courſe, to walk in that way which the Saints went for the attaining thereto. There is no doubt, but that this prayer is as well heard, as was Bala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams, who deſired to be in the companie of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raell,<note place="margin">Dur. Rat. lib. <hi>4.</hi> Nico. de Plo. de expoſ. Miſſ.</note> and that his ſoule might die the death of the righteous. Howbeit, theſe Gallauntes our young Maiſters neuer alleadge anie ſuch cauſe, but ſay, That it is becauſe that the Angelles aunſwer him, and that this is the verie place wherein they doe this office.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>d</hi> There is neuer a place in all this ioly maſke
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:19770:120"/>and moriſdaunce, wherein Sir Gurdegobreaſſe better, or more notablie beſtirreth his ſleight fingers, nor wherein he cauſeth his God more Iuſtelie leape ouer, about, and on euerie ſide his Chalice, or yet maketh him fetch more daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous ſompleſauntes fore right, thwart, and eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie way, then in this. And beſides, after he hath made him friske and gambaulde his fill, then he ſheweth him on the one ſide of him, and not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer his head as he did before: But all on the one ſide, as our Roging bearewardes are wonted to doe with their Apes, when they haue cauſed them ſkippe and daunce vntill they can no more: as if hee ſhould ſaye as they are wonted: Nowe Iacke, ſee thy keeper. Here Sir Gurdegobreaſſe maketh other manner of countenaunces, then earſt he did, when he was ſo penſiue and alone. For he right well ſheweth that the goute is not in his fingers. And beſides, there is neuer a place that he had neede take greater heede vnto, that he make not roundelles in ſteade of croſſes, then this, according to the aduertiſement that we haue alreadie ſet downe in the Cautelles. For, he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth about his woorke ſo nimblie, as that a man would thinke that he did but tourne and returne his hands, as though he would make nothing but roundels, or elſe Saint Andrewes croſſes, in ſtead of foreright croſſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>e</hi> If all honour and glorie be due vnto God, as it is in deede, why then do theſe blaſphemours ſo often ſpoile him thereof, and eſpecially in their Maſſes, giuing it to creatures.</p>
               <pb n="215" facs="tcp:19770:120"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>f</hi> This aduertiſement is to teach Sir Gurde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gobreas how to compas his turnes &amp; halfe turnes which here he muſt make. But who woulde not tremble with feare, to heare the words which they here ſpeake? For, they alwayes call their rounde cake which they make here friske and gambauld, The Lordes bodie. Are they not afcarde, thus to blaſpheme him? For, if this be the bodie of Ieſus, muſt he be thus ledde and played withall? Was there euer Cat in takinge of a mouſe, that euer played with the mouſe, as they playe with him? What is he that can but maruel at the great good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God, that is able ſo long to abide theſe ſo horible blaſphemies, as to call a rounde cake, the bodie of the Sonne of God, and beſides make it thus trippe and daunce?</p>

Howbeit,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:19770:121"/>we wil not buſy our heades any farther about this geare. It ſhall ſuffice vs to vnderſtand, that our young maiſters expound the paten, to ſignifie the largenes of charitie. And ſurely they haue great reaſon in it. For, there is no doubt, but that theſe our young maiſters haue very large platters and ſaucers at their table. Moreouer, after that Syr Gurdegobreas hath played the paſſion and death of Ieſus Chriſt, he paſſeth from that, and thruſteth him ſelfe in, to playe the buriall, reſurrection and aſcenſion, euen to the verye ende of the Maſſe. And becauſe, when he hath made his white God luſtily daunce and ſkippe, he nowe layeth him downe to reſt a while: howbeit he reſteth not there long. And after he hath lifted him vp, he lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him downe againe, and when he hath crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, he putteth him into the graue. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he keepeth here againe ſilence, as he doth in the recitall of the Canon: Therefore this place of the Maſſe, is properly called the Silence: and the Prieſt, ſoftly and ſecretly ſayeth this prayer, after he hath ſayd the Lordes prayer, becauſe he hath put his Ieſus into the Sepulchre. And in this ſort expound they theſe ceremonies, and all the reſt of the ceremonies that follow. Howbeit this ſhoulde neuer haue needed, if a man would but touch the tenth parte of the dotages which theſe dottrels ſet forth, to make them agree with their fooliſh dreames.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>c</hi> It hath heretofore bene ſayd, That the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles appointed the Lordes prayer, which they cal Dominicall, to be recited in the ſupper. And we a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:19770:122"/>reade, that this was ordeined by Gregorye the firſt, and that he added this litle preface, which the Prieſt reciteth before it. Wherevpon, there were ſome that noted him of folly,<note place="margin">Berno. Microlog. de offic. Miſſ. Ca. <hi>12.</hi> Dur. Rat. lib. <hi>4</hi> Rub. de patr. no. Nico. de Plou. <hi>5.</hi> part. Expo. Miſſ. Li. Concil.</note> &amp; reprehended him for it. And therfore he was enforced to purge &amp; defend him ſelfe of it, as in his regiſtre we read: where he, amongeſt other his reaſons alleageth: That it was not likely, that the prayers which the ſchoolemen collected, and put into the Canon, were to be recited, and therefore much leſſe the Lordes prayer. And becauſe there were certaine Prieſtes in Spayne, which ſayd it not, It was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyned in the fourth Councell of Tolete, celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted about the time of Honourius the firſt, that what ſoeuer Prieſt, or Clarke, that ſayd it not aſwell in the publicque office, as in the perticular, ſhould be depoſed from his dignitie and office. It is wonder to ſee how ſhamefaſt our young maiſters are here. For they ſpeake as if they durſt not ſay this pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, except they were commaunded &amp; taught to do it out of the doctrine of Ieſus Chriſt: without which, in truth they ought not do. For they ought not take in hande any diuine ſeruice, without his ordenance. But why were they not ſo aſhamed, in all the reſt of their dealings? And wherfore were they ſo bold, raſhe, &amp; arrogant, to thruſt in ſuch a number of their doting inuentions, dreames, and blaſphemies, into the pure &amp; holy ordenaunce of Ieſus, the ſonne of god? Moreouer, we might ſhew how well this praier agreeth with their owne do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, if we had not ſet the ſame forth at large in thoſe our dialogues, wherin we haue made an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:19770:122"/>of the ſame: howbeit we wil here touch only one point, that greatlieſt appertaineth to this matter: and that is this, that when our Lord Ieſus Chriſt teacheth vs to ſeeke after god our father in heauen, he admoniſheth vs, that he wil be ſerued with a ſpirituall ſeruice, &amp; which alone he accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth of, as our Lord Ieſus Chriſt him ſelfe teacheth vs, in the talke which he had with the woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary,<note place="margin">

Nowe, we muſt not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip &amp; honor the ſonne, otherwiſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we would honor the father, becauſe there is alwaies but one &amp; the ſelf ſame eſſential &amp; ſubſtantiall God. And therfore if we will worſhip him, as he is to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped, we muſt lift our hartes vp vnto heauen, where Ieſus Chriſt, as S. Paule telleth vs,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 3.</note> ſitteth at the right hande of God his father: &amp; not ſeeke to worſhippe him here below on earth in a peece of bread, a round cake, a goblet, in the handes of my yong M. in a pyxe, amongſt vermine &amp; myſe, who are alwaies at warre with this poore white God. Wherefore, we are throughly to conſider of thoſe words which the Prieſt ſpeaketh, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he nameth heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in the beginning of his praier. Where he ad<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>moniſeth vs to lift vp our hartes, &amp; after when he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to ſay, <hi>Pane<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> noſtru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp;c.</hi> our daily bread, he in many places lifteth vp his round cake aboue his ſhoulders, as if he would ſay, let him alone in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, &amp; worſhip him here in this round cake. Or, it may be, he doth it for this purpoſe, to declare that this round cake, is the daily bread of theſe young maſters. For they may boldly vau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that he feedeth them, and that he hath many of theſe <hi>praeſta quaeſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> young maſters, who would haue very hungry
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:19770:123"/>bellies and leane chappes, if this iolly litle round ſhorne God, like a Prieſtes round ſhorne crowne, gotte them not two or three, two pences a daye, through out the yeare.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>d</hi> After that my young maiſter hath made great ſporte with his round cake, and his goblet, then muſt his ſaucer alſo haue his turne.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>e</hi> In other places the Clarkes, or els the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, ſay Amen. But here, our maiſter Martin him ſelfe ſayeth it: wherein, I tel you, are no ſmal my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries. Howbeit we will not tell what they are, becauſe they are aboue our reache. And beſides, After he hath alowd roared out the Pater noſter, he againe returneth to the mumbling vp of other blaſphemous prayers, calling vpon others, then Ieſus Chriſt. Now, our young maiſters yeeld a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſtrong and notable reaſon, for the roaring out of the Lordes prayer, ſeeing that all the whole ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non is ſayd in ſecrete, and beſides, all the reſt of the prayers which followe immediatly after. It is, ſay they, becauſe this prayer is taken out of the Goſpell, and becauſe that Ieſus Chriſt commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that that which he ſayd in ſecrete, and in the eare, ſhould be preached aboue in the houſe tops, in the open places and ſtreetes. Wherein I can not but take it in good part, and greatly thanke them for their ſo free confeſſing of the truth. Wherevp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>o<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, we may co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarywiſe conclude, that it is no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, though they mumble vp and buzze all the reſt, and eſpecially their whole Canon, ſecretly &amp; ſoftly, as all Coniurers doe, which is cleane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the doctrine of the Goſpell, and full of

                  <hi>a</hi> MArke here an horrible and wicked kinde of ſpeach. For, he ſpeaketh in this place, of the body of Chriſt, as of the bodye of a theefe which ſhould be deliuered into the hangmans handes, to be broken &amp; laid vpon the wheele. And although he be notwithſtanding commaunded, very reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently to receiue it, yet he meaneth forthwith to breake it in peeces: and that ouer the Chalice, for feare any peece thereof ſhould fall beſide it, &amp; ſo be loſt. The Romiſh maſſe booke, and the maſſe booke that is ſet forth according to the vſe of Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanne, call it ſomewhat more cunningly. For, in ſteede of calling it the body, they call it the hoſte, which, he muſt firſt of all breake into two peeces, &amp; after that, breake one of thoſe two peeces into two other peeces, to the end there might be three in all. Now, herein are againe diuerſe and ſundrye myſteries, myſtical ſenſes, &amp; ſtraung expoſitions, touching this breaking, &amp; the peeces of them, &amp; the ſignifications of euery of them, howbeit it is enough that we haue ſufficiently ſpoken of this traſh els where.

And it is no maruell, though he ſpeaketh his wordes thriſe one after another.

I will ſay nothing of the blaſphemie that is in it, wherein this blaſphemer deſireth that the mixture which is made with that draught of wine, might be for the ſaluation both of ſoule and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, of all thoſe that ſhould drinke thereof, and a preparatiue for the receiuing of euerlaſting life. But let vs now ſpeake what an hard matter it is on the contrarye ſide, where it is forbidden to
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:19770:126"/>mingle the bread and wine together, as we haue els where declared: and where commaundement is giuen, that they ſhould be receiued ſeuerally: according to the ordenaunce of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, and not one, without the other: as may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare by the decrees which are recited vnder the names of Iulius the firſt, and Gelaſius the firſt. Wherfore, by theſe decrees, It is not lawful by the firſt, either for Prieſt or people, to mingle any of theſe thinges one with another: nor yet receiue the bread without the wine. Nowe, let our young maiſters, if it may ſtand with their good pleaſures, reſolue vs of this hard doubt: &amp; yeld vs a ſounder reſolution then that which is ſet downe in the gloſe of the decrees: or els it will breede them a great inconuenience in the matter.

               <p>
                  <hi>a</hi> IF there is none other that can giue peace, nor fight for vs, but God alone, which in deede, we muſt needes acknowledge and confeſſe: we are not then to deſire theſe thinges at the handes ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of men or yet women Saintes: nor yet make S. George, S. Chriſtofer, or yet S. Barbara, and ſuch like, the patrones of warre, as the heathen made Perſeus, Minerua, and Bellona the Goddes and Goddeſſes of warre, in the ſtead of Mars.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>b</hi> The Prieſt, as the popiſh maner is, kiſſeth the Aultar, &amp; giuing the pax to the Clarke, ſaith, peace be with thee: and the Clarke aunſwereth, And with thy ſpirite.<note place="margin">Miſſ. R. Berno de offic. Miſſ. Ca. <hi>18.</hi>
                  </note> Berno ſayth, that the pax, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ordenance of Innocent, is giuen before the Communion: ſignifying thereby, that he eateth his owne iudgement, which preſumeth
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:19770:127"/>to communicate, before ſuch time as he be firſt reconciled to his brother, and hath agreed with him. Here againe we ſee, that he ioyneth the pax with the Communion: which no whit agreeth with that, that Durand and his companions haue els where brought in. But muſt he haue an Idol to put him in mind of that, whereof the Supper and Communion is a Sacrament? In ſteade of this Idol my young maiſter kiſſeth, as we haue before ſayd, either the Aultar, the image of the crucifyx, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques, or els the ſawcer, which they call the Pate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. In other places, when any mariage is ſolemnized, both the Bridegroome and the Bride alſo, muſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen their purſes wide, if they meane to kiſſe this iolly Idoll the pax. In very deede, if it brought the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a good and longe laſting peace, they coulde not pay too much for it. Howbeit it behoueth them to haue another maner of peace then they ſhall get by it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>c</hi> Here is to be noted, that in this kind of dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, my younge maiſter is called father: which thing in deede, oftentimes falleth out rightly, and eſpecially when the ſonne helpeth the father to ſay maſſe, as it many times commeth to paſſe in this great multitude of Prieſtes baſtards.</p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>e</hi> Although this blaſphemer deſireth God here, to make him worthy of this Sacrament, yet would he haue forgiuenes of his ſinnes, and by his merites, be repleniſhed with the grace of the holy Ghoſt, and not by the death and paſſion of Ieſus
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:19770:128"/>Chriſt alone.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>f</hi> He confeſſeth here, that there is none other ſaluation but in God alone, and yet for all this he ſeeketh for more, and addreſſeth him ſelfe more to other creatures then vnto him, who is the alone Sauiour, and creator of all things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>g</hi> There were ſome reaſon in this prayer, if it were applied to the true ſupper of Ieſus Chriſt, which ſendeth vs vnto his death: by which we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue his body and blood, which is the fruite, that is here by them required, &amp; not by this moſt bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphemous ſacrifice, whereof me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion is made in the Canon.<note place="margin">Micro. de offic. Miſſ. Ca. <hi>18.</hi>
                  </note> Berno ſayth that this prayer is not taken out of any certaine order or vſage, but onely from the traditions and inuentions of deuout men. He ſayth the like of others alſo, which are ſayd in the deliuering and receiuing of the Communion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>h</hi> Here is a prayerful of great blaſphemy. For our Sauiour Chriſt ſayth,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn.</hi> 6.</note> That whoſoeuer eateth me, liueth by the meanes of me. And yet this bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphemer prayeth, that the receiuing of his bodye might not turne to his condemnation. Howbeit, this ſo groſſe an error &amp; blaſphemy, proceedeth from that which we haue ſo often heard out of the proſe of Thomas of Aquine, which hath hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in part bene expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, for want of diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing the difference that is betwene the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the faithful, &amp; the faithles, &amp; of the ſigne, without the thing ſigned, &amp; with it. There might be here ſome likelyhood, if he meant, by the body of our Lord Ieſus, the bread which it preſenteth: howbeit he vnderſtandeth it after the popiſh ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:19770:128"/>For ſo the faithles may receiue the ſigne: but none can receiue the body of our Lorde, ſignified thereby, but the faithfull onely.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>a</hi> THe bodie of Chriſt is not a round cake de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided into foure quarters, as is the rounde cake of this our Sir Gurdegobreaſſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>b</hi> He muſt receaue another kinde of breade, then this round cake, if he will haue the heauenly bread.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>c</hi> Here is a verie pitifull Sir Gurdey.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>d</hi> Here is a pleaſant Centurio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who ſpeaketh vnto his round cake, euen as the Centurion in the Goſpell, ſpake vnto Ieſus the very Sonne of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>e</hi> The houſe rouffe of this ſcuruie ſhaueling, is his belly, wherinto, he meaneth like a rauening wolfe, to ſwallowe vp, this ſillie lambe which he now calleth Lorde, vpon whome before, he hath called for mercie, that afterward he might deuour him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>f</hi> The bodie, that is to ſay, the round cake, is verie eaſilie to be handled, and very light to croſſe him ſelfe, and ſerue him to play withall like a flie flap, becauſe the flies ſhould not trouble and vex him when he is at breakefaſt, and drinking of his wine.</p>
               <pb n="234" facs="tcp:19770:130"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>g</hi> Such a prayer, no whit appertaineth vnto this round cake, nor yet vnto this banquet wherat Ieſus Chriſt is not preſent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>h</hi> Here, he more honoureth his Goblet, then he doth the bodie of his God. Howbeit I doe not greatly maruell at that: Becauſe his Goblet is made either of goulde, ſiluer, or at leaſt, of verie fine tinne: and his God, is made of no better ſtuffe, then of a peece of paaſt. And beſides, the Goblet is a pleaſaunt thing to ſuch ſipping mates.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>i</hi> Theſe verſes of Dauid are here againe as properly applied as they were in that place, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they were heretofore propounded.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>k</hi> Here, hee muſt make the Goblet alſo, to friske a little about for the croſſing of him ſelfe, as well as hee made the rounde cake friske about to croſſe his reuerende worſhipful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>l</hi> This wine and this water are no blood, as that was which he euen nowe ſwallowed downe, but are onely giuen him to make cleane and rinſe his Goblet and wide weaſant, leaſt there ſhould remaine any blood in them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>m</hi> But in this prayer, which he here maketh at his laſt waſhing, which they call purifying, is great reaſon: For they haue reaſon to purifie and cleanſe them ſelues, after they haue polluted their handes and mouthes, with ſuch horrible ſacrileadges and blaſphemies, committed as well againſt the death and paſſion, as alſo againſt the bodie and blood of our Sauiour and Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:19770:130"/>Ieſus Chriſt. Howbeit let vs conſider of that which they ſpeake. Howe ſhall we receaue the ſelfe ſame thing with our ſoules, which we receiue with our mouthes? For, the ſoule hath no ſuch mouthas the body hath, neither doth it eate or yet drink ſo: neither is it in ſuch ſort fed, either with ſuch meates &amp; ſuch drinkes. For, bread &amp; wine, do ſerue to feede the bodie, and not the ſoule, ſaue that the ſoule is taught by them, by reaſon of the bodelie ſenſes, of ſpirituall and inuiſible thinges, which are ſignified by theſe viſible and materiall ſignes. But the right meate and drinke of the ſoule, are the bodie and blood of Ieſus Chriſt, not corporallie taken by the mouth of the bodie, as the Popiſh Church teacheth. But ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituallie, by the mouth of faith: which is the mouth of the ſoule and ſpirite, by meane where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the bodie is alſo afterwarde ſpirituallie fedde, and it can not otherwiſe bee. For, admit, that a man ſhould eate the verie bodie, and drinke the verie blood of our Lorde and Sauiour Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, yet ſhould neither ſoule nor bodie Communicate thereof, nor yet be fedde there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, vnto euerlaſtinge life. For, the heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie and deuine meate and drinke, is ſpirituall, and receaued by fayth. And where that is, we ſhall neede none other. And therefore, the ſignes of breade and wine that are diſtributed to vs in the Supper, are not giuen vs, that with them and by them wee ſhoulde receaue the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and blood of our Lorde and Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt, as if a peece of fleſh ſhould be giuen vs
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:19770:131"/>to eate without bread, or in paaſt, and wine in a cup to drinke, as the Romiſh rabble, and certaine others, vnderſtande and take it, who corporallie conioyne the ſignes, with the thinges ſigned and ſignified: But are giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to vs, liuely to repreſent vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our bodily ſenſes, that which our Lorde repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenteth to our inward ſenſes, or rather to ſtirre vp and diſpoſe the whole man, to receaue the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly and diuine giftes, through faith and in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite. Againe, if this bread and wine which the Prieſt receaueth in the Supper vnto him ſelf alone are the bodie and blood of Ieſus Chriſt, as he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it, and woulde haue men beleeue it, ſo that there remaineth no more ſubſtance of the breade and wine: then ſurely, this gift and preſent is not corporall, but euerlaſting euen as Ieſus Chriſt him ſelfe is. And therefore he doeth him great wrong, ſo to name it. If this the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be not the bodie &amp; bloud of Ieſus Chriſt, but onely breade and wine, as in verie deed it is: which way can he make it becom a remedie for eternall life? which remedie is in none but in Ieſus Chriſt alone. And beſides, we ar here further to note that, which the Prieſt ſayeth, as if there were manie, which banquetted with him at the verie ſame table, &amp; as if they had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated of the ſelfe ſame Sacrament. Is not this a maruelous kinde of mockerie? He, verily thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, that this prayer was not made to be ſayed in particular Maſſes, but when the people commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated together.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>n</hi> He forgetteth not here to ſucke his fingers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>o</hi> Our yong Maiſters ſay, that after this Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:19770:131"/>is done, the bodie of Ieſus Chriſt retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to heauen. Howbeit this our ſcabd, ſcald, ſhorne Squier, who gobleth him vp, meaneth to haue him remaine in his entrailes and bowelles. It is alſo written in that ſmall pamphlet called <hi>Stella Clericorum,</hi> that the Prieſt is Ieſus Chriſt his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulcher, becauſe he ſwalloweth downe his bodie and blood into his bellie. Morouer, he hath great reaſon to haue his ſinnes cleanſed by the meanes of theſe notable and pure Sacramentes which he hath receaued, by which, he hath ſo horriblie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced and blaſphemed, euen Ieſus Chriſt him ſelfe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>p</hi> We here ſee, a verie pleaſant Simeon, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging that ſong, which that good Simeon ſoong, when he held the yong child Ieſus Chriſt in his armes. Howbeit this our newe Simeon, hath done much more, if we would beleeue him: For, he hath holden him, handled and toſſed him, both aliue &amp; dead, euen as bigge and great as he was, when he hoong vpon the wodden croſſe. May not he then verie well ſing, like the good ſeruant of Ieſus Chriſt, who hath verie notablie honored &amp; mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified the glorie of his Maiſter?</p>

Here againe we ſee, a verie euident teſtimonie of the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the auncient Maſſe. Whereof there was a Decree in the fourth Councell of Tolete: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in mention is made that certaine Prieſtes Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated immediatlie after the Lordes prayer was ſayed: and after, bleſſed the people. Which thing is there forbidden, and commaundement giuen, to bleſſe the people after the Lords prayer: &amp; beſides, that the Sacrament of the body &amp; blud of the Lorde, ſhould be receiued in this maner, to wit, that the Prieſts and deacons ſhould commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate before the Altar, the Clergie in the Quier,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:19770:162"/>&amp; the people without in the bodie of the church. So that by this decree, there was but one common Supper for them all. And there was no difference in it, but the diſtinction of places, which was done for the auoiding of confuſion in the Church. And becauſe that in all ages, there were alwayes many people, who honoured not, nor reuerenced the Sacramentes, ne yet the Communion of the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, as they ought: The auncient Councels made manie ordinaunces about them: as that for one, which hath alreadie bin alleaged, as to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate thriſe a yeare at the leaſt, if not oftener, which is continued amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt the decrees of the Agathens Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cell:<note place="margin">Ex lib.

Wherein we may againe ſe, that theſe offices of the Romiſh Church, haue beene made without anie great iudgement, as good as they are. For howe often haue they bene amended, and yet to no purpoſe? And beſides, they ſet down this peece as a prayer, and action of thankeſgiuing, neither hath this bin in it a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  <hi>f</hi> This is the ſixt time that the Prieſt ſaluteth the people, there lacketh now non but the laſt, &amp; that is to cloſe vp the Maſſe withall. The firſt is, before the firſt collect: The ſecond, before the Goſpell: The third, after the Creede: The fourth at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the preface: The fift, before he ſayeth, The peace of the Lord be with you. In this ſixt, he turneth himſelfe towards the people, as he doeth in the laſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>g</hi> There is greater reaſon to call this peece, the Action of thankeſgiuing, then the other, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deringe what name it carrieth with it, which ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth, that it ought to be ſaid after the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion: and the other that goeth before, during the Communion, whereof it carieth the name. For, thanks are properly rendred after that the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is done. This word againe, giueth vs to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that there ought to be a Communion in the Maſſe, and not the Prieſt his breakefaſt alone, which ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be ſo called. There is a rule ſet down that as many prayers muſt be ſaid for this poſtco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>
                  <hi>h</hi> Me thinketh that there are verie improper and obſcure kinds of ſpeaches in this prayer: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that in the reſt it is to be born withal. For, the taking and receauing of the bodie &amp; blood of Ieſus Chriſt, to ſpeake properly, is not temporall: as wel becauſe we receaue them not onely for the time, wherein we outwardly receaue the ſignes of them in the Supper, neither yet for anie temporal life: but that they ſhould remaine alwayes in vs,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:19770:133"/>and we by them, be fed and refreſhed. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this ought to be ſaid, of the outward ſignes &amp; adminiſtration of the Supper, which prefigureth that perfect fruition of the Lords Table which is prepared for vs in heauen, where we ſhall eate of the deſired bread in the kingdome of God: which banquet we begin alreadie here, by a ſpiritual co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Now, here is to be noted, that the Prieſt playeth both Ieſus Chriſt his part in his aſcenſion vnto heauen, and alſo the part of the Angelles who ſpake vnto the Apoſtles after his aſcenſion: and the people, play the part of the retourning of the Apoſtles vnto Ieruſalem, after the aſcenſion, or according to the expoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <pb n="244" facs="tcp:19770:134"/>of Iohn Baleth, of the returning of the people of Iſraell from Babilon. I beſeech you are not here great reaſons in euerie of theſe gentle expoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>b</hi> Moreouer, this leaue is not alwayes giuen after one maner of faſhion, according to the rule which is here ſet down. For, if it be not giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with <hi>Ite miſſa eſt,</hi> the Prieſt turneth not himſelf vnto the people. And here Durand rendreth a reaſon of this diuerſitie,<note place="margin">Rat. li, <hi>4.</hi> par. Rub. de ora. no.</note> ſaying, that <hi>Ite miſſa eſt,</hi> was, in the old time ſayed, when as the people met together in great numbers at Maſſe, by reaſon of the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that then was made, to giue them leaue after this maner: &amp; that at other times, when the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple did not aſſemble after that ſort, they vſed ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kinde of faſhion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>c</hi> If the faithfull that are dead reſt alreadie in peace, as before hath bene ſaid, then is this a vaine prayer for that purpoſe that they make it. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, they ſay that there is no peace graunted for the dead in the Maſſe, &amp; that there is no mention at all made of them in the ſame, becauſe they haue no neede thereof. And therefore it ſhould ſeeme by this, that they are quite &amp; clane forgotten in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>d</hi> Euen as all the reſt of the Romiſh Maſſe, as at this day it is, is nothing elſe but a continuall blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheming of the name of God, and of the merit &amp; paſſion of the death of Ieſus Chriſt: it can not be choſen, but that it muſt alſo conclude with a moſt horrible and curſed blaſphemie. For after that the Prieſt hath forſaken Ieſus Chriſt the Sonne of God, and withall, both the Father, and the holie Ghoſt alſo, in him: he prayeth that the holie Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:19770:134"/>would accept of this ſo inſupportable blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemie: manifeſtly confeſſing, that he taketh his Maſſe to be not onelie a Sacrifice of praiſe and thankeſgiuing: but alſo a propitiatorie Sacrifice, for the obtaining, by meane thereof, remiſſion of ſinnes, which we no wayes can obtaine, but by the onelie Sacrifice which Ieſus Chriſt made: as hath alreadie bene often ſaid. And ſeeing it is ſo, it was impoſſible to make a better concluſion of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the Maſſe, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Nicholas de Ploue hath there made: greatly commending, not onely this prayer which wee here preſently ſpeake of,<note place="margin">Tract fac. de expoſ. Miſſ. <hi>6.</hi> part.</note> but alſo the curteſies &amp; bowings that are to be made in the ſaying thereof: mightelie reprouing al ſuch as ſay it not, as it is here ordained. Wherevpon, he bringeth foorth for his authoritie,<note place="margin">A very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaunt tale.</note> a maruelouſe pleaſant tale as followeth. There was, quoth he, a man poſſeſt with a deuill, who was brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a certaine Prieſt, whome this Prieſt aſked, what he thought of two other Prieſtes which hee named vnto him. Then this deuill that tormented this poore wretched man, ſaid vnto him, The firſt Prieſt, quoth he, which thou namedſt vnto me, was ſometime ours, but he is now the Lords. And as for the other, quoth this gentle maiſter deuill, would be a verie honeſt man if it were not for ſtealing. This Prieſt who had demaunded of this M. the deuil his prophet, this queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, greatly mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelled to heare this anſwer, becauſe he tooke this prieſt, of whom the deuill made him this auſwer, to be a verie holie man. Whervpon he determined to enquire further of him more ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tially, aſking
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:19770:135"/>him, what it was that he would ſteale, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill anſwered, That it was this laſt prayer, whereof we now ſpeake. Vpon which anſwer enquiry was made, whether it was ſo as the deuill had ſated or not, &amp; it was found ſo in deed. Whervpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this ſaid Nicholas de Ploue, a Doctor of the decrees, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, that the Prieſts ought, not onely to be verie carefull to ſee that this prayer, with theſe ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, were not omitted, but alſo nothing elſe, that was wonted to be obſerued in the Church, in the Maſſe. What is he then that will not in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, haue great regard herevnto, conſidering that ſo great a Doctor as the deuill is, is a witnes herof, &amp; hath giuen his ſentence &amp; iudgement vpon the ſame? For, without all doubt, this is a doctor, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet &amp; witneſſe, that is worthy to be brought in in ſuch a matter. For, he is able to be a witnes therof, as of a matter of his owne handie work, which he right well vnderſtood and knew.</p>

                  <hi>a</hi> BEcauſe this our Iuggler would bid his table farewell, that he might go to another, where he ſhould haue better cheere, he croſſeth and kiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth it for his laſt farewell.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>b</hi> Soone after, becauſe he hath playd in this enterlude, with his Chaſuble, all that is needefull, he pulleth of that peece firſt, which he laſt put on. Then pawſeth he a while, ſtill ſtanding in his white ſmocke with the reſt of his masking robes, for the ending of ſome parte of the playe that yet remaineth behind vnplayed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>c</hi> There is a Canon in the Salegunſtadien Councell,<note place="margin">Lib. Con.</note> celebrated in the dayes of Pope Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict the eight, and of the Emperour Henry the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond: wherein, mention is made of the ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of certaine men and women, which cuſtoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly alwayes had the beginning of the Goſpell af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter S. Iohn, and of the eſpeciall Maſſes of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, and of S. Michael, &amp;c. which thing is there forbidden. Nowe, the maner of the reciting of this peece of the Goſpell, after S. Iohn, which the Prieſt here reciteth in the ende of his Maſſe, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing els but ſuch a meere ſuperſtition and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery as was forbidden in this Councell. For it is not ſayd, to inſtruct the people withall, becauſe it is onely buzzed vp in the teeth without the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and vnderſtanding of any. Neither is it ſayde for a prayer, becauſe there is no ſuch matter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:19770:137"/>within it, but onely a doctrine to inſtruct vs in the fayth of the diuinite and humanite of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt. Howbeit, it ſhould ſeme, that the prieſt which recyteth it, and they that heare it do great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meryte, onely for hearing of it recyted, or for that it is there, recyted: and that there is great ver<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tue in the wordes thereof, though no body vnder<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtand them, by reaſon of the iolly wordes and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table matters that ar in it. Wherin they are much like the Iewes, who attribute as great vertue to the wordes and ſillable of the names of God, which they haue in their languag in the holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tures, as if the power of God were tyed to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>d</hi> This prayer is very neceſſary for all theiſe Gentlemen ſacryficers, Moonckes, Fryers, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes, and Miniſters of Antechriſt. For, the feare which they haue of looſing their temporall bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites, maketh them altogether forget heauen, and all heauenly and eternall benefites. For why do they all, ſo ſtoutly oppoſe them ſelues vnto the Goſpell of Ieſus Chriſt, and reformation of the Chriſtian Church, for the mayntenaunce of their ſacrilegous Maſſe, the very ſyncke of all blaſphemyes: mens tradytions, full of all ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitions and Idolatryes: and the popiſh ſea alſo, the very ſea of Antichriſt, and of all abhomy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, ſaue onely for the temporall benefites which they receaue thereby, and fearing to loſe them? For take away from them theyr luſty pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bendes and fatt benefices, which they haue for the mayntenaunce of theiſe filthy and ſtynkyng abhomynations of theyrs, and they will ſoone
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:19770:137"/>after, care but a litle for them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>e</hi> We haue els where ſpoken of the orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce, which biddeth the people to beware, how they preſume to go from Maſſe, before ſuch tyme as they haue the prieſtes bleſſing, and that the ſolemnite of the Maſſe be finiſhed. This ordenaunce is conteyned within the Canons of the Agathenſan councell,<note place="margin">Lib. Con.</note> where it is ordeyned that the Biſhopp ſhould bring all thoſe to open ſhame and to do open penaunce which did the contrary. And in the firſt Councell of Orleaunce likewiſe,<note place="margin">Ber. de offic. Miſſ. Ca. <hi>20.</hi> Alam. de offic. Miſſ. C. <hi>36.37</hi> Dur. Rat. lib. <hi>4</hi> De ben nom.</note> celebrated about the tyme of Pope Hormiſde, wherein it is ordeyned, that the peo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple ſhould receiue the prieſt his bleſſing, if the Biſhoppe were not there. This is to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoode of the laſte bleſſing, which is a double bleſſing: For they ſende one of them immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after the <hi>Ite Miſſa eſt,</hi> or, <hi>Benedicamus Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no.</hi> And beſides, there is yet another, which they call, the very laſt, by comparing it with the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt: which, they ſaye, repreſenteth the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of the holye Ghoſt, that was ſent vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Apoſtles. Vppon Whiteſondaye, as the other, repreſenteth the aſcenſion, becauſe Ieſus Chriſte bleſſed his Apoſtles and Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,<note place="margin">Luke. <hi>24.</hi> Nichol. de.

                  </note> when he aſcended into heauen. Nowe, becauſe there are two bleſſings, it is to be doubted, of which of theſe two theſe fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayd Canons, meane. Howebeit, Alamarius ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth downe a ful and reſolute determination here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, ſatisfying all ſuche as are deſirous to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtande, in what place the Maſſe properly
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:19770:138"/>beginneth and endeth, to the ende that if they can not be preſent at the whole diuine office, yet that they might be at the leaſt, at the principall parte thereof, and which is properly of the Maſſe and of the very ſubſtaunce of it. Whereupon he ſayth, That the Maſſe beginneth properly,<note place="margin">VVhen the Maſſe begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth.</note> euen there, where the Prieſt beginneth the ſacrifice: that is, in that place wherein we haue begoone the third parte thereof, according to the diuiſion which we haue followed, and which ſome at this preſent vſe: and ſayth, that it endeth with that bleſſing, which is with the <hi>Ite, Miſſa est.</hi> And for confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his iudgement, he alleageth Iſidore, who ſayeth that the Maſſe beginneth at that ſame ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry place,<note place="margin">Iſidore. li. Ety.</note> where the Catechumeni are put forth, when as the Deacon cryeth out, and ſayeth, if there be any one of the Catechumeni, let him goe out. And all that which he there ſayeth, confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth aſmuch as we haue already heretofore ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, of the Maſſe of the Catechumeni, and of the faithfull. And beſides all this, the ſayde Alamarius rendreth a reaſon, why there is no mention made in the Memento, but for the faithfull that are li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, and namely for thoſe which are there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. Becauſe ſayth he, that in the action of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament there is no prayer made, but for the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and the ſacrament is adminiſtred to none but to them. And therefore they cauſe all the reſt to goe out.<note place="margin">Ber. Micr. de offic. Miſſ. Ca. <hi>21.</hi> Con. Tol. Ca. <hi>18.</hi> Con. Aga. Ca. <hi>44.</hi>
                  </note> Moreouer, Berno moueth a queſtion, to knowe what kinde of men they are that ought to giue this bleſſing, becauſe that Pope Damaſus the firſt, gaue this power and authoritie onely to Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:19770:138"/>where Leo and Gelaſius neuer forbad the Prieſts, except the Biſhop him ſelfe were preſent.<note place="margin">Hieroni Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stic. Narbo.</note> He alleageth alſo the teſtimony of S. Ierome, by whome, he againe ſheweth, that if the Prieſtes haue right power and authoritie to conſecrate &amp; adminiſter the Sacrament of the ſupper, that they ought alſo aſwell giue the bleſſing to the people. Berno, for the reſoluing of this doubt, ſayeth, that there is either a fault in the booke, of the matter which is written of Damaſus, or els that this orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce muſt be taken, according to Leo and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſius their meanings, either els that the cuſtome of the Church did afterward cary it away, &amp; that it was of greater force and authoritie, then the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denaunce of Damaſſus. And in the ende he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth, that this authoritie was in the olde time, only giuen to the Biſhops, becauſe as he thought it was not greatly neceſſary for to haue the prieſts giue the bleſſing, ſeeing that there were none of the faithfull that continued at the Maſſe, but ſuch as did communicate: vnto whome, the prayer that is called the poſtcommunion (which was appoynted for none but for the Communicants) ſerued in ſteede of the bleſſing. But whenas in proceſſe of time, the people were withoulden fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Communion, and yet could not be ſuffred to be at the diuiue ſeruice, there was a tolleration graunted, that the Prieſt might giue the people the bleſſing, to the ende it ſhould not ſeeme that they ſhould goe away bereaued both of the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and alſo of the Communion. To be ſhort, how euer it was, were it by reaſon of this occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:19770:139"/>or otherwiſe, he concludeth, that the cuſtome of the Church grewe to be ſuch, as that this bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the Prieſt could not be omitted, without great offence,<note place="margin">C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </note> whatſoeuer either Damaſus, or yet the Agathenſian Councell, had herein ordained, which thought it to be ſo meant, as Damaſus had alleaged. I haue here of purpoſe, againe ſet downe theſe things, that euery man might the better vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, what great difference there is betwene the Maſſe, as it is at this day in the popiſh church, and the maner that was vſed therein, in the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Church, to the end it might not be thought, that this Maſſe of the Popiſh church, is vſed in the diuine ſeruice, after that maner that it was in the auncient church we: alſo ſee the ſuperſtitious dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference that was betwene the office of the Biſhop and the Prieſt, being thus diuided in two, in ſuche maner and forme, and for the reaſons which we haue heretofore, els where rendred. For ſeing that the miniſtery both of Biſhops and Prieſtes, hath bene alwaies one &amp; the ſelfe ſame miniſtery, ſo farre forth as it toucheth, &amp; extendeth it ſelfe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to preaching, &amp; adminiſtration of the ſacraments: why ſhoulde not the bleſſing of the one, be of as great effect &amp; power, as the bleſſing of the other, conſidering that Bleſſing, is prayer, and that that prayer which the miniſters of the Church make, is made as it were in the perſon of the Lord God, and in the name and behalfe of the whole church, whereof the miniſter is as it were the mouth, by which God him ſelfe ſpeaketh, and offreth and giueth his bleſſing and power to this holy mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:19770:139"/>which he him ſelfe hath ordeyned? My meaning is, by this my ſpeach, of the miniſterye of the Goſpell, and of the true miniſters there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>f</hi> After that the Prieſt hath pronounced his laſt bleſſing, he putteth of all his masking robes, which he before had put on, to play this parte, and againe mumbleth vp his prayers, as he did when he made him ſelf ready: but the Lord God know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to what great purpoſe they are ſayd, and ſo buzzed vp.</p>
